Vladimir Guerrero Jr.
Blue Jays 3B
Notes:
Hit: 80 | Power: 70 | Speed: 40 | Fielding: 40 | Arm: 55
Scouting Report: Guerrero is a prodigious offensive talent, with the combination of hitting ability, plate discipline and power in the mold of Manny Ramirez. Guerrero has high-end bat speed and outstanding bat control. With hitting mannerisms reminiscent of his father, Guerrero has a compact but aggressive swing. With his hand-eye coordination, he has excellent plate coverage, barreling premium velocity while also possessing the pitch recognition skills to square up all types offspeed pitches, too. He has plus-plus raw power now, with 30-homer years likely in his future and a chance for 40. He drew more walks (76) than strikeouts (62) in 2017 and has the potential to contend for batting titles. A gifted offensive player, Guerrero did not inherit his father's speed or athleticism. He trained as an outfielder when he was an amateur and figured to be a left fielder at best, but after the Blue Jays signed him they put him at third base. He has surprised scouts with his play there, improving his arm strength to above-average and showing the hands to be a playable defender. However, Guerrero is already so big and stocky as a teenager that it's going to be a challenge for him to maintain his weight. Even if he moves to first base or possibly left field, his bat is good enough to be a premium player there too.

Ronald Acuna Jr.
Braves OF
Notes:
Hit: 60 | Power: 70 | Speed: 70 | Fielding: 70 | Arm: 60
Scouting Report: Acuna has a wide range of strengths and few glaring weaknesses. Multiple scouts predicted multiple all-star appearances in his future. He's the rare prospect who actually carries future 60 (or better) grades on the 20-80 scale for all five tools. Acuna is a 70 runner with 70 defense who has a 60 arm and 60 hit tool. He already uses the whole field, and he went deep six times in 2017 to right or right-center field. Acuna used the opposite field more often as the season progressed. Not coincidentally he became tougher to strike out. Scouts looking for flaws noted that his strong arm is sometimes inaccurate and he could sometimes be stymied by quality fastballs up and in. But he already shows an ability to lay off breaking balls and velocity out of the zone. When he gets a pitch to hit, Acuna has extremely fast hands with strong wrists that whip the bat through the zone with excellent bat speed. He already generates exceptional exit velocities, which should pay off with 25-30 home runs once he matures.

Juan Soto
Nationals OF
Notes:
Hit: 70 | Power: 60 | Speed: 50 | Fielding: 55 | Arm: 50
Scouting Report: Soto impressed evaluators with his advanced feel at the plate. He made adjustments within at-bats and displayed impressive hand-eye coordination that should allow him to be an above-average hitter. While he's still growing into it, Soto should have above-average power, thanks to strong hands and a simple swing. He is just an average runner, and profiles as a corner outfielder because of that, which put additional pressure on his bat-his best tool. He currently has fringe-average arm strength that is better suited to left field than right, but he uses his legs efficiently on throws and is young enough to safely project an average arm as he continues to mature.

Eloy Jimenez
White Sox OF
Notes:
Hit: 60 | Power: 70 | Speed: 40 | Fielding: 45 | Arm: 45
Scouting Report: Scouts who saw Jimenez last season used words like "man-child," "mutant" and "Superman." More specifically, Jimenez is an intimidating, strong-bodied prospect with a whip-quick bat capable of massive home runs. More than his raw power, which approaches the top of the scale, he is a diligent, dedicated worker. One manager recalled seeing Jimenez strike out multiple times during a game, then saw him on the field early the next day for tracking drills. Rival managers lamented not being able to find many holes in his swing, even when they pitched him backwards. And here's the scary part: Jimenez might not be done developing physically. He played all of 2017 at 20 years old and still has room to sculpt his body and add more strength, possibly becoming a perennial 40-home run threat. Jimenez has spent his career flipping back and forth between right and left field, with left his likely eventual home because of his below-average arm. He's also a tick below-average runner. Defense and speed were never expected to be selling points of his game, however. Jimenez is a hitter, period, with a mix of power and ability to get to it to change a game.

Victor Robles
Nationals OF
Notes:
Hit: 60 | Power: 50 | Speed: 70 | Fielding: 70 | Arm: 60
Scouting Report: Robles' advanced understanding of the strike zone and ability to recognize pitches have helped his quick hands play in the batter's box. He is currently an average power hitter but with the strength and bat speed to project more power as he continues to develop physically. He was pitched backwards frequently in the Carolina League, which he countered by regularly using the entire field and showing the ability to drive the ball to the right-center field gap. Robles is fearless in the box and sets up very close to the plate. He led the Carolina league with 17 hit by pitches despite having just 338 plate appearances. He plays with great energy and aggression, which can hurt him at times, particularly on the bases where he needs to improve his decision-making and basestealing ability, though that might be the only part of his game to nitpick. Robles improved the most in 2017 in the outfield, where he has improved his jumps and routes. He also made strides with his throwing accuracy. He's always had the tools to develop into a premier defensive center fielder, with well above-average speed and a plus arm, and he's now taking the steps to become more efficient.

Bo Bichette
Blue Jays SS
Notes:
Hit: 70 | Power: 60 | Speed: 50 | Fielding: 50 | Arm: 55
Scouting Report: Bichette loads his swing with an aggressive leg kick and unleashes a powerful swing with fierce bat speed. He's consistently on time and on plane through the hitting zone for a long time, which allows him to barrel balls at a high rate. Bichette has a good sense for the strike zone and uses the whole field, with above-average power and loft to go deep to all fields. Bichette’s biggest strides have come on the defensive side. While the consensus earlier in his career was that he would probably end up playing second or third base, Bichette now looks like a true shortstop. He he has improved his agility, getting good reads off the bat with quick feet, good body control and he turns double plays well with an above-average arm.

Nick Senzel
Reds 3B/2B
Notes:
Hit: 60 | Power: 60 | Speed: 55 | Fielding: 60 | Arm: 60
Scouting Report: Scouts see plenty to like about Senzel from a tools standpoint, but those who have seen him time and again like the intangibles just as much. He runs hard, grinds out at-bats, takes extra bases, plays smart in the field and leads his team. He's not only the best player on the field but plays the hardest. That mentality is coupled with a good approach at the plate and a short, compact swing with good balance and bat speed, leading to high exit velocity off the bat. Opponents say they rarely see him get fooled, and he constantly barrels balls. While many questioned his power coming out of college, he has shown the ability to drive the ball to all fields. Among his 10 Double-A homers were multiple shots to center field and the opposite field. Though not a prototypical burner, he still shows above-average speed to go with good instincts on the bases. Defensively, Senzel has shown the potential to be a plus defender at third with a strong, accurate arm that he has shown he can use on the run. He played shortstop and second base in addition to third base in college, but he has proven to be a quick study at third.

Fernando Tatis Jr.
Padres SS
Notes:
Hit: 60 | Power: 60 | Speed: 50 | Fielding: 55 | Arm: 60
Scouting Report: Early in 2017, Tatis would come to the plate without a plan and get caught swinging over breaking balls on the outer half, but he quickly adjusted and became a precocious mix of power and patience. He tracks pitches well and consistently drives hittable offerings with excellent extension and leverage through his swing. Balls jump off his bat from gap to gap, and he shows plus power with towering pull-side home runs. Tatis cut his strikeout rate each successive month at Fort Wayne, and at the time he was promoted, he led the Midwest League in walks. He enhances his offensive game with his basestealing ability. He is an average runner whose speed plays up on the bases with his instincts, reads and jumps. At shortstop, Tatis frequently makes highlight-reel plays and shows off a plus, accurate arm, but on a play-to-play basis, evaluators see fringy range and many project a move to third base if he grows bigger. Tatis will stay at shortstop for now and has the actions to stick there if he maintains his body. In addition to his physical talents, Tatis is a natural leader. He is nearly bilingual and an effective communicator with impressive self-awareness for his age.

Forrest Whitley
Astros RHP
Notes:
Fastball: 70 | Curveball: 60 | Slider: 60 | Changeup: 55 | Cutter: 50 | Control: 55
Scouting Report: Few young pitchers are as advanced as Whitley, and few can match the quality of his stuff. He entered 2017 with four quality pitches and left it with five. All his pitches are at least average and a trio are already plus. Pitching with an over-the-top arm slot emphasizes the downhill plane on his fastball, and Whitley can blow hitters away at 92-97 mph. He actually is even more comfortable toying with batters with his varied assortment of offspeed pitches, and he commands his breaking balls better than his fastball at this point in his career. His plus 84-87 mph slider has modest depth but strong tilt as it dances away from his opponent's bat head as it nears the plate. His 78-82 mph curveball is also plus with a big 12-to-6 break. At times his changeup will also show otherworldly movement, when it dives down and away from the barrel of lefthanded batters. And in 2017 he refined a 90-92 mph cutter that some scouts throw a plus grade on. With so many pitches, Whitley can stick one or two in his back pocket early in the game, then break them out the second time through the order. One of the few criticisms raised is that he's a slow worker. Whitley will miss the first 50 games of the 2018 season due to a suspension for an unspecified violation of baseball’s drug program.

Michael Kopech
White Sox RHP
Notes:
Fastball: 80 | Slider: 60 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 45
Scouting Report: Kopech's calling card is his top-of-the-scale fastball, which sits in the upper 90s and regularly touches 100 mph with armside run and downhill plane. It's an elite pitch, but he overthrows it at times. The White Sox asked Kopech to add a two-seam fastball to induce more grounders and help teach him not to overthrow. He boasts a slider that projects as a future plus pitch, as well as an average low-90s changeup the White Sox encouraged him to throw more. Kopech still needs to iron out his delivery in order to improve his below-average command and control.

Mitch Keller
Pirates RHP
Notes:
Fastball: 70 | Curveball: 60 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 60
Scouting Report: Keller has put on muscle to a rangy frame, which allows him to produce easy velocity without overly stressing his arm. His fastball sits 94-96 mph with late life, tilt and armside run. He can hit 99 when he rears back. His fastball command is improving, and he can throw it to all four quadrants against batters on either side of the plate. His heater sets up a big looping curveball with an 11-5 shape with hard downward bite. He still considers his fastball his best pitch, but the Pirates are trying to convince him to trust his curveball. Their next goal is to help him with a developing changeup, which is still an average pitch for him. It has armside run and sink, but he probably needs to take something off because it comes in too close to 90 mph.

Kyle Tucker
Astros OF
Notes:
Hit: 60 | Power: 60 | Speed: 50 | Fielding: 55 | Arm: 50
Scouting Report: Tucker's swing has never been picture perfect. He begins his swing with the bat laid back over his shoulder, leading to a little bit of a sweepy beginning. But it's hard to argue with the results. His excellent hand-eye coordination leads to ton of contact, and as he has gotten stronger he's turned doubles into home runs. Tucker isn't a true center fielder, but he has a chance to be fringe-average there while being above-average in the corners with an average arm that works in either spot. He's an average runner who has shown a knack for stealing bases.

Alex Reyes
Cardinals RHP
Notes:
Fastball: 80 | Curveball: 70 | Changeup: 60 | Control: 50
Scouting Report: When Reyes is healthy, few pitchers can match his pure stuff. Strongly built with wide shoulders and thick, sturdy legs, he averages 97 mph with his fastball and touches triple digits with ease. He holds his velocity deep into his starts, blowing hitters away even when they know his fastball is coming. Reyes' command is imperfect, but he excels at elevating his fastball to get swings and misses. He backs up his top-of-the-scale fastball with knee-buckling hammer curveball at 78-81 mph, and his previously raw 88-91 mph changeup began increasingly playing as plus. He also began experimenting with an 83-86 mph short slider. Reyes struggles at times finding a rhythm for his delivery and the result has been below-average control his entire career, the one issue that prevents him from profiling as a No. 1 starter. Reyes' track record of staying on the mound is also becoming increasingly spotty. He missed a month in 2015 with a sore shoulder, was suspended 50 games in 2016 after testing positive for marijuana in the Arizona Fall League and now has Tommy John surgery on his ledger. In response, he got noticeably stronger during his rehab, replacing fat with muscle and improving his eating habits to enhance his general fitness.

Rays SS
Notes:
Hit: 55 | Power: 45 | Speed: 50 | Fielding: 60 | Arm: 60
Scouting Report: Adames has been considered a premier defensive shortstop since the Rays acquired him for his projectable body and mature approach in the David Price trade with the Tigers in 2014. His arm strength has increased over the past two seasons, and he displays excellent first-step quickness, plus range and soft hands. He's an ideal No. 2 hitter, and his bat has developed with his loose and easy swing. He narrowed his stance in 2017 to stay short to the ball and prevent over-striding. He has a solid feel for the strike zone, sees the ball early, and drives pitches consistently with some pop at the plate. Very coachable with a great work ethic, he is an average runner with good instincts.

Royce Lewis
Twins SS
Notes:
Hit: 60 | Power: 55 | Speed: 60 | Fielding: 60 | Arm: 55
Scouting Report: Pre-draft concerns about Lewis' hit tool proved unwarranted, and he had no problem making the necessary adjustments for a smooth transition to pro ball in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League. Hitting coordinator Rick Eckstein got him to use his hips and legs better, and that opened up the pull side for Lewis, who homered on a full count in his first pro plate appearance. With a high waist and wide shoulders, he showed excellent plate discipline and an all-fields approach that drew comps to Ian Desmond. Lewis has plus speed and advanced instincts on the bases, where he was caught stealing just three times in 21 attempts. Lewis saw time at shortstop, third base and center field in high school, and he worked hard with the Twins to improve his range at shortstop with better positioning and pre-pitch anticipation. He flashed plus arm strength before the draft but saw that wane under the Florida heat and an increased workload. A separated left shoulder suffered in high school hasn't been an issue so far. Lewis' makeup and work ethic are off the charts, and his demeanor and ability to connect with teammates, fans and media are reminiscent of Carlos Correa or a young Derek Jeter. After a week or so, Ramon Borrego, his GCL manager, was calling for Lewis to skip the Rookie-level Appalachian League and be promoted all the way to low Class A Cedar Rapids. That eventually came in early August.

Notes:
Fastball: 70 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 60 | Control: 60
Scouting Report: Sanchez is one of the hardest-throwing starting pitchers in the minors, but you wouldn't know it from his delivery. He has easy, fluid mechanics that he repeats consistently, helping him command a lively fastball that sits in the mid-90s and touches 100 mph. Sanchez can overpower hitters with his fastball, though he's working to polish his secondary pitches to miss more bats. His changeup flashes plus with good sink and run, and it helps him thwart lefties, though he needs to do a better job of repeating the same arm slot as his fastball. His slider is average now but could be above-average if he can add more power.

Brendan Rodgers
Rockies SS
Notes:
Hit: 60 | Power: 55 | Speed: 50 | Fielding: 55 | Arm: 60
Scouting Report: Rodgers' calling card is his smooth, controlled swing that bodes well for him to hit for average and power. He possesses the bat speed to handle any velocity and the balance and pitch recognition to barrel breaking balls. At times Rodgers becomes too pull-happy, but he has shown he has the strength to drive the ball the other way. Rodgers rarely walks, but knows how to work a count and doesn't miss the pitch he wants. Evaluators nearly universally regard him as a future plus hitter with enough power to impact a game. A natural shortstop, Rodgers has also seen time at second and third base with the Rockies' approach of having players work at multiple positions in the minors. Rodgers has the reliable hands, quick release and plus arm strength to play shortstop, but his fringy footspeed could be a deciding factor in an eventual move to second base. Rodgers makes up for his lack of natural range by positioning himself well and showing advanced instincts, enough that some evaluators give him a chance to stay at shortstop and be a possibly average defender there, although not all are convinced.

Notes:
Fastball: 80 | Slider: 70 | Changeup: 45 | Control: 45
Scouting Report: Gohara's pure stuff compares favorably with anyone. In just 29 big league innings, he threw more 98-plus mph fastballs than any other lefty starter. His 95-99 mph fastball generates top-of-the- scale grades and his 82-85 mph slider is equally impressive because it looks like his fastball coming out of his hand before diving with late tilt. He shows some feel for a changeup, but it lacks late fade and he struggles to keep it on the edges of the plate. Gohara's control is fringe-average at best, but he has made significant strides and should develop average control.

Notes:
Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 55 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 60 | Control: 60 | Screwball: 70
Scouting Report: Honeywell will miss the entire 2018 season after having Tommy John surgery in spring training. When healthy, Honeywell mixes five pitches-count 'em, five!-with precision to keep hitters off balance. He works off his plus fastball that sits 92-93 mph and touches 96, and he features solid movement and above-average command. His best secondary pitch is a plus changeup, which coaxes hitters to chase outside the strike zone on occasion. He throws his above-average curveball primarily early in counts to set hitters up while altering their eye level. His above-average slider resides in the mid-80s and is developing into a plus pitch with its improving sharp break. Honeywell also throws a screwball, which earned him some recognition early in his career. He pulls the plus offering out of his bag a few times a game, and more often than not, the results are devastating. Honeywell is a cerebral pitcher who knows how to get opponents out, and he's never afraid to challenge batters. A driven and determined young man, Honeywell understands the need to make adjustments. He did just that over the course of 2017, improving the consistency of his release point and getting better extension on his fastball.

Mike Soroka
Braves RHP
Notes:
Fastball: 60 | Slider: 60 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 60
Scouting Report: Soroka is a sinker/slider pitcher who touches 95 mph but lives at 90-93 mph with his two-seamer. His delivery has a little crossfire action that adds deception and has not affected his plus control. He started to throw his four-seamer more alters hitters' eye levels. Soroka's plus breaking ball is hard to classify. At it's best it's an above-average 84-86 mph curveball because of 1-to-7 shape, but it's tighter and has a sharper break than normal. When his adrenaline is flowing, it morphs into a high-80s pitch with slider tilt. His changeup flashes above-average with some late run but could use more consistency. His sinker and breaking ball eat up righthanders, but those same offerings end up down and in where lefties can feast, so his changeup must show run away from lefties.

Scouting Report: An elite athlete with a sky-high leg kick in his delivery, Gore blends his supreme athleticism with an advanced four-pitch arsenal and top-notch competitive makeup. His fastball operates 92-95 mph, plays up thanks to plus command and gets on hitters quickly with good extension out of his delivery. His mid-70s curveball with tight 1-to-7 snap is another plus pitch, and his tumbling 82-85 mph swing-and-miss changeup was even better than expected after signing. His low-80s short slider gives him another potential plus offering. Many evaluators who saw Gore in his pro debut called him one of the best pitching prospects in 30-year history of the Rookie-level Arizona League.

Scouting Report: Riley has embraced the Braves' focus on improving his nutritional habits. He appears slimmer, stronger and quicker than he was when drafted. He also has shortened his swing and improved his bat speed, helping him to more consistently get to his plus power potential and elevating himself to an above-average hitter, whereas his previous ceiling was considered average. Riley's biggest improvement has come defensively. He has alleviated fears he would need to move to first base and is now an above-average third baseman. His plus-plus arm is still his calling card, but he also improved his first-step quickness.

Notes:
Hit: 60 | Power: 70 | Speed: 70 | Fielding: 55 | Arm: 60
Scouting Report: The Angels believed Adell possessed the best combination of power, speed and arm strength in the 2017 draft. He has shown top-of-the-scale speed, has the strength to mash 450-foot homers and the arm to make laser-like throws from the outfield. The broad-shouldered, muscular Adell stands out most for his quick-twitch athleticism, bat speed, raw power and ability to make consistent hard contact. His quick hands allow him to get to high pitches and he shows maturity in his at-bats and work ethic. He may not become an elite defender but is solidly above-average in center or right field. Adell's speed may not translate into stolen bases as he matures physically and adds muscle.

Scouting Report: Ruiz is a special switch-hitter with "a chance to be a star" in the words of one evaluator. He possesses superb timing, bat speed and ability to manipulate the barrel, and he began to learn to elevate for home runs toward the end of 2017. He makes solid contact from both sides but is much stronger lefthanded. Behind the plate, Ruiz has good timing blocking balls and handles both good velocity and breaking stuff, but he loses focus at times and lets pitches get away from him. He has average arm strength but an uncoordinated exchange and inconsistent footwork cause him below-average pop times on throws down to second base.

Scouting Report: Despite standing just 5-foot-10, Sheffield packs lightning in his left arm. His fastball can sit in the mid-90s, and he has touched as high as 98 mph. Sheffield's fastball generates plenty of swings and misses thanks to intense riding life and a deceptive delivery. He couples the pitch with a slider and changeup that both project as above-average to plus. His slider, which sits in the mid-80s, ranks slightly ahead of his changeup, which sits in the high 80s. Sheffield missed a significant chunk of time in 2017 with a severely strained oblique muscle, so the Yankees sent him to the Arizona Fall League to make up innings.

Scouting Report: McKay has a simple, sound swing that generates live drives to all fields. He adds above-average raw power that could generate 20-plus home runs should he add more loft to his swing. McKay worked on incorporating his lower half at the plate during instructional league. While his footwork at first base is solid, he needs reps at the position. On the mound, McKay commands a fastball that sat 92-94 mph while pitching on Sundays at Hudson Valley. His heater has excellent late movement, making it difficult for batters to barrel. He mixes his fastball with a hard cutter and a slurvy slider that complements the other two offerings.

His bat has untapped power that should come as his body fills out. Trammell's plus-plus speed helps cover poor jumps in the field. He projects as an average defender in center field, but his well below-average arm could limit him to left field.

Scouting Report: Urias rarely expands his strike zone, forcing pitchers to come to him. When they do he uses his elite hand-eye coordination and quick swing to drive all types of pitches on a line to the outfield. Though he doesn't elevate for home runs, he makes consistent hard contact with exit velocities in line with Yoan Moncada, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and other top prospects. He rarely swings and misses, and projects as a true plus-plus hitter. Defensively Urias is an athletic, above-average second baseman with reliable hands, excellent footwork and an impressive vertical leap. He has an above-average arm and is capable of filling in at shortstop.

Jesus Luzardo
Athletics LHP
Notes:
Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 55 | Changeup: 60 | Control: 55
Scouting Report: Born in Peru and raised in South Florida, Luzardo was viewed by area scouts as a possible first-round pick in 2016 before he had Tommy John surgery that March. The Nationals are a team that has never shied away from draft talented pitchers who are recovering from Tommy John surgery. They drafted him in the third round and gave him a $1.4 million signing bonus. Luzardo had pitched in only three Gulf Coast League games in 2017 before Washington sent him to the Athletics in the deal that brought Sean Doolittle and Ryan Madson to the Nats. Luzardo's abbreviated 2017 season with three teams was impressive: a combined 1.66 ERA in 43.1 innings, with 48 strikeouts and five walks. Poised, confident and smart are adjectives used to describe the lefthander, and his stuff is prodigious too. Luzardo can reach 97 mph with his fastball and has solid command of his curveball. He's developing a changeup that is already seen as above-average by some scouts. He has a simple arm stroke and a repeatable delivery. He appears to understand the art of pitching quite well for someone who's a mere 20 years old. Considering Luzardo hasn't pitched above short-season, he remains many years away from the big league club. But also considering his tools and his refined skills at such a young age, he has the potential to rise to the level of a solid No. 3-or-better starter in the not-so-distant future.

Hit: 60 | Power: 55 | Speed: 60 | Fielding: 60 | Arm: 50
Scouting Report: Throughout his career, Meadows has shown a smooth swing, good feel for the barrel and the strike zone, so his struggles at Triple-A don't worry the Pirates. They trust that Meadows will be a plus hitter who will develop consistent home run power, even if it doesn't come early in his major league career. He is a plus runner with solid outfield instincts. His arm is his weakest tool, but it's still adequate enough to play all three outfield spots.

Jesus Sanchez
Rays OF
Notes:
Hit: 60 | Power: 55 | Speed: 55 | Fielding: 50 | Arm: 50
Scouting Report: Sanchez has shown the ability to perform every aspect of the game at a young age. As a 19-year-old in the MWL, he displayed excellent hand-eye coordination that led to hard and consistent contact, while limiting his strikeouts to 18 percent of the time. He has a smooth and easy, whip-like swing from the left side and quick wrists that allow him to hit velocity and adjust to offspeed pitches. Most of his power has come when he pulls the ball, but given his age and raw strength, Sanchez should be a run producer at higher levels. His greatest need centers on gaining consistency with his leg kick so as not to drift on the front side. He also needs to improve his overall pitch selection. Sanchez has a long running stride that generates above-average speed once he gets moving. He moved from center field to left in 2017 and has the range and arm strength to be above-average at the position.

Francisco Mejia
Indians C
Notes:
Hit: 60 | Power: 45 | Speed: 40 | Fielding: 45 | Arm: 80
Scouting Report: Mejia has long been known for his hitting ability, and the switch-hitter consistently makes hard contact from both sides of the plate. He has matured as a hitter to use the whole field to hit, instead of relying on the pull-oriented approach he had when he was younger. His bat speed gives him more raw power than his lean 5-foot-10 frame would suggest, but he more typically drives balls into the gaps than over the fence. He has an aggressive approach and doesn't walk much, but his excellent feel for the barrel means he also doesn't strike out much and is comfortable working behind in the count. Mejia has made strides defensively, has elite arm strength and has shown flashes of being a good receiver, although his overall receiving and effort level behind the plate draw mixed reviews. He has gotten comfortable speaking English, a key skill for him to work with his pitchers. Because Mejia's bat isn't far off from being ready for the big leagues, and because the Indians have Yan Gomes and Roberto Perez, a pair of excellent defensive catchers, in Cleveland, Mejia went to the Arizona Fall League to get experience at third base. He is naturally still learning the position but he will continue to see action at the hot corner in 2018.

Michel Baez
Padres RHP
Notes:
Fastball: 70 | Curveball: 55 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 60 | Control: 60
Scouting Report: Baez possesses a power arm and pounds the the strike zone downhill out of his high three-quarters arm slot. He holds his fastball at 94-95 mph and frequently touches 98 to grade as a plus-plus pitch. His fastball comes out easy, and he hides the ball well behind his enormous frame. Baez's upper-80s slider flashes plus but isn't yet consistent. His mid-80s changeup flashes plus with fade away from lefthanders, and he flashes a hammer 11-to-5 curveball in the upper 70s. Most importantly he repeats his delivery to throw frequent strikes, perhaps too many. He allowed as many home runs as walks (eight) in the MWL regular season.

Triston McKenzie
Indians RHP
Notes:
Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 60 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 55
Scouting Report: McKenzie's fastball can get up to 95 mph and averaged about 92 in 2017. He held that velocity throughout the season, and while it would dip during starts, he also showed the ability to reach back for more at the end of his outings. His fastball plays up and gets swings and misses thanks to the extension in his delivery and the high spin rate on the pitch. He also has a feel for spinning his curveball, which can be an out pitch. His changeup isn't as advanced but has the potential to be above-average. McKenzie needs to improve his routines and physique to allow him to manage a starter's workload.

Notes:
Fastball: 70 | Curveball: 60 | Slider: 60 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 50
Scouting Report: Wright's plus-plus fastball ranges from 92-98 mph, with late life at its best to go with excellent angle. His command is better when he's pitching in the lower registers of his velocity range. Wright's curveball and slider both generate potential plus grades, but he often shows a knack for locating one or the other, depending on the day. His curveball is a low- 80s pitch with late break and good depth. His harder mid-80s slider has modest break but plenty of power. His mid-80s changeup is his fourth pitch for now but shows excellent fade and run when he's locked in.

Alex Verdugo
Dodgers OF
Notes:
Hit: 60 | Power: 50 | Speed: 50 | Fielding: 55 | Arm: 70
Scouting Report: Verdugo possesses a keen eye that led to more walks (52) than strikeouts (50) at Triple-A Oklahoma City, and he keeps it simple when he does get a pitch to hit. He has excellent rhythm and body control and a level, line-drive swing that allows him to drive the ball all over the field. He doesn't have much lift in his swing, but evaluators see enough strength and bat-to-ball skills to project about average power to go with a .290 or better average. Verdugo has average speed and it plays up in center field with good instincts and a quick first step. His best tool is his plus-plus, accurate arm. Verdugo's skills are undeniable, but criticisms of his effort level and maturity have plagued him since his amateur days and were again prevalent in 2017.

Fastball: 80 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 55
Scouting Report: Greene pitches at 98-100 mph and touches 102 with a top-of-the-scale fastball. What's most notable is how easy he gets to triple-digit velocity. His slider flashes plus and his changeup has been more consistently plus, but he still is inconsistent with both of them. He commands his fastball well, even when nearing the century mark, although scouts looking for nits to pick note that hitters seem to see the ball well coming out of Greene's hand. At the plate he's shown raw power, but scouts worried about his hit tool. A steady glove at shortstop, he also has an obvious plus-plus arm.

Willie Calhoun
Rangers OF
Notes:
Hit: 60 | Power: 60 | Speed: 30 | Fielding: 30 | Arm: 40
Scouting Report: Calhoun has a smaller, stocky frame, but frequent reminders he's too small or too slow help fuel his motivation. Calhoun is one of the most talented hitting prospects in game, with an outstanding combination of barrel control and power. He has great rhythm and balance in the batter's box, quick hands and powerful hip rotation. He has good hand-eye coordination and a compact swing that stays on plane through the hitting zone for a long time. He has great plate coverage, with little problem handling premium velocity or barreling breaking pitches. He seldom swings and misses and struck out just 11 percent of the time at Triple-A. He hit 32 home runs in 2017 and could be a 35-plus home run threat in the big leagues. Calhoun's stature gives him a smaller strike zone to cover, and he doesn't expand it by chasing much. He tried playing second base with the Dodgers, but he's a well below-average runner with a below-average arm who didn't show much range at the position and often struggled to make routine plays. Calhoun showed some signs of progress in 2017, but in June the Dodgers started getting him work in left field. After joining the Rangers, Calhoun played left field almost exclusively.

Franklin Perez
Tigers RHP
Notes:
Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 60 | Slider: 45 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 60
Scouting Report: The Tigers have pitching prospects with higher ceilings than Perez, but not one who combines stuff and feel like Perez. While he is less likely to be an ace, Perez also is about as safe a bet as a young pitcher can be to become a big league starter. For a young pitcher, he already understands many of the finer details of his craft. He responds quickly to instruction and shows an aptitude for adjustments. After working on a new grip for his slider in just one side session, he successfully took it into his next game. Perez generally sits 92-94 mph, though he can touch 96. Some scouts believe he may end up throwing a little harder in his 20s because his delivery is clean and he has plenty of athleticism. What's most notable is that Perez commands all four of his pitches. His 75-80 mph curveball is his best secondary pitch. He has long had an ability to spin it with 12-to-6 break, and he has shown he can loosen it as an early-count strike or tighten it up as a swing-and-miss out pitch. His changeup is a potentially average pitch as well, with more deception than late fade. His newly-added slider comes in at 88-89 mph with late movement. Perez hasn’t pitched yet in 2018 due to a right lat strain and he is expected to be out until late June.

Braves RHP
Notes:
Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 60 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 50
Scouting Report: The Braves' initial point of emphasis with young pitchers is to teach them to throw a quality changeup. Anderson embraced the pitch, developing it from afterthought to a pitch that flashes above-average in the span of a year. The improved change gives him a chance to end up with three above-average pitches. His 91-95 mph fastball touches 97, and he gets downhill thanks to his over-the-top delivery. As he worked on his change, Anderson relied less on his plus curveball with 12-to-6 action. Scouts believe Anderson has advanced control and command for his age, despite his walk rate of 4.7 per nine innings.

Jake Bauers
Rays 1B
Notes:
Hit: 55 | Power: 50 | Speed: 50 | Fielding: 50 | Arm: 45
Scouting Report: Bauers has a pure stroke from the left side and an advanced approach that led to 78 walks in 2017, good for second in the International League. His willingness to wait for his pitch and ability to barrel the ball with his superior hand-eye coordination leads to a high on-base percentage. Bauers' solid-average bat speed generates raw power, but it has not shown consistently in game action. Scouts believe that he will generate plenty of extra-base hits to contribute as a first baseman in the big leagues. Bauers runs well and is intelligent on the bases. Despite seeing action as a corner outfielder, he's much more effective at first base, where he displays quick feet, soft hands and a solid overall feel for the position.

Scouting Report: Hiura has a short, powerful stroke with tremendous bat speed and a good feel for the strike zone. He has explosive, strong hands with raw power that projects to be above-average. He will hit for average and show power to all fields. He is an average runner albeit not a basestealer. He played the outfield and second base in college, and some evaluators think he is destined for left field. The Brewers plan to give Hiura every chance to play second base, and barring any future elbow issues, he certainly has the arm strength to play the position.

Scouting Report: At his best, Faedo has three plus pitches. He manipulates his 90-94 mph fastball and can cut it, sink it or make it run. His low-80s slider was among the best in the college class, and he can toy with its bite and depth. His changeup falls off at the plate, giving him another swing-and-miss pitch. His stuff was not as firm early in the 2017 college season, and he can get too reliant on his slider, but overall he offers a well-honed three-pitch package. While Faedo has a long arm action, he has average to above-average control.

Notes:
Fastball: 70 | Slider: 60 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 45
Scouting Report: Puk looked like he could have made an impact at the major league level in 2018, but he will miss the entire season after having Tommy John surgery in April. Puk's raw stuff has never been questioned. His fastball resides comfortably at 93-96 mph and can reach 98. His vicious side-to-side slider grades easily as plus and his changeup has developed into an potentially above-average pitch. Control has long been an issue, but A's minor league pitching instructor Gil Patterson helped Puk streamline his delivery, focusing mainly on his front leg. The altered motion produced a more consistent release point. With his 6-foot-7 height, Puk gets a pronounced downward angle in his delivery, which can make him both effective and intimidating. He gets a high percentage of swings and misses with all of his pitches. His stuff, competitiveness and pitching sense are all assets. So is his receptiveness to coaching. Over the past two years, the A's have arranged to have Randy Johnson and Al Leiter-two elite lefthanders in their day-give Puk advice.

Scouting Report: Taveras has a chance for five average to plus tools at a premium position. He has a simple, balanced swing from both sides, uses his hands well to generate bat speed and has a clean swing path. Taveras makes frequent contact and stays through the ball well, which allows him to use the whole field, and he could develop into a plus hitter. His strike-zone discipline continued to improve in 2017, and he started to flash more pop, with a lean, projectable frame that should help him develop average power. Taveras glides around center field with plus speed, good instincts and quick reads off the bat to go with a plus arm that is accurate.

Notes:
Hit: 55 | Power: 60 | Speed: 50 | Fielding: 50 | Arm: 45
Scouting Report: Alvarez earned a spot in the Futures Game in 2017, his first full season. A wrist injury sapped his power in the second half, but when healthy Alvarez showed some of the best power in the organization. He produces high exit velocities and has 25-plus home run potential. His swing is not really geared for power, but the ball carries thanks to leverage and bat speed. Alvarez uses a whole-field approach, and hit more home runs to the opposite field than his pull side. He has a big strike zone, but his ability to recognize breaking balls and lay off pitches out of the zone helps him cover the plate. Alvarez is an above-average runner underway and is a better left fielder than first baseman. His fringe-average arm is his worst attribute.

Florial hit .298 and drew 50 walks in 2017 and projects to stick in center field, where he has a well above-average arm. He's got above-average raw power that is beginning to play in games. A plus-plus runner, he regularly gets down the line to first base in fewer than four seconds.

Notes:
Hit: 55 | Power: 60 | Speed: 50 | Fielding: 55 | Arm: 60
Scouting Report: A baseball rat who has endeared himself to Orioles brass for his lack of batting gloves and a playing style that's energetic-bordering-on-reckless, Hays' compact swing and above-average bat speed help him attack the ball and drive it to all fields, and he has proved to be particularly adept at hitting fastballs in any count. While he controls the barrel and can be a plus hitter with plus power, his aggression in attacking fastballs made him susceptible to major league secondary pitches, an issue that Hays and the Orioles knew of before his stint in the big leagues and believe can be improved with more experience. Hays can be an above-average right fielder thanks to a plus arm and good instincts in the field, and he has played some center field. Though he hasn't stolen many bases as a professional, he runs a tick above average and always hustles out of the box.

Jon Duplantier
D-backs RHP
Notes:
Fastball: 55 | Curveball: 55 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 60
Scouting Report: Duplantier has an athletic build and a solid, sturdy frame with room to grow. His arm action is a bit funky because he extends his arm straight behind him just after separation, leading to a delivery that can appear stiff or robotic. But he repeats it well, and coaches say he makes adjustments quickly when he gets out of whack. Duplantier has the potential for a legitimate four-pitch mix. His fastball velocity fluctuated at times in 2017, but he sat mostly 90-94 mph. His stuff ticked up late in the season, when he sat 93-94 mph and topped out at 97. He throws both a four-seamer and a two-seamer and both pitches have armside run. His most consistent secondary pitch is a spike curveball, but coaches believe his new slider has the most upside. He also throws a changeup that generates average to above-average grades. Duplantier is proud that he was able to make all of his starts in 2017, saying he grew more confident in his health as the season progressed. Still, the D-backs proceeded cautiously by waiting until mid-June before promoting him from low Class A Kane County to high Class A Visalia.

Notes:
Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 45 | Slider: 50 | Changeup: 70 | Control: 50
Scouting Report: The Padres streamlined Quantrill's mechanics to help his velocity come easier, and it did in 2017. He now sits comfortably at 93-95 mph and can reach back for 97. He holds that velocity, pitches downhill and commands his fastball, making it a plus pitch. His 81-83 mph changeup is his out pitch and one of the best in the minors. He sells it with identical arm speed as his fastball, and the pitch slows suddenly just in front of the plate. His 81-84 mph slider flashes above-average but lacks consistency, and the Padres are focused on developing his mid-70s curveball. Quantrill throws all his pitches for strikes and has above-average command.

Scouting Report: Hansen starts his arsenal with a mid-90s fastball that peaks at 98 mph. He gets downward plane on the pitch, and the White Sox made mechanical tweaks-namely keeping his shoulders even throughout his delivery-to help keep his fastball life consistent. Hansen couples his fastball with a hard curveball that flashes plus potential. He improved his changeup from a show-me pitch at Oklahoma to one with heavy sink and average potential. He's also working to develop a slider. Hansen's imposing size gives him an intimidation factor on the mound but also contributes to inconsistent command and control.

Scouting Report: Eloy Jimenez is the top prospect in the White Sox system and is farther along, but Robert's tools are just as impressive. He boasts a strong, lean frame at 6-foot-3 and 220 pounds. His swing is compact and simple, and he produces well above-average bat speed. He's got plus raw power and slugged three homers in limited time in the Dominican Summer League. He does swing and miss on elevated fastballs, but it's not a huge ding on his record. Robert was rated as a solid-average to plus runner as an amateur, but he has gotten faster as he matured and now earns plus-plus grades for his speed. The White Sox believe Robert will be able to maintain enough speed and range to stay in center field. If that doesn't work out, his bat will more than play in a corner.

Rangers OF
Notes:
Hit: 55 | Power: 55 | Speed: 60 | Fielding: 55 | Arm: 50
Scouting Report: Under the previous Collective Bargaining Agreement, teams were able to blast through their international bonus pools, which is how Cuban outfielder Luis Robert signed with the White Sox for a $26 million bonus in 2017. Martinez is subject to the new rules, which is why he had to settle for $2.8 million from the Rangers. Martinez had been one of the top players left in Cuba, having starred in the country’s junior leagues and then in Cuba’s top league, Serie Nacional, where in his final season he batted .333/.469/.498 in 264 plate appearances with 52 walks, 30 strikeouts, six home runs and 24 stolen bases in 29 attempts. Though he’s not that big, Martinez has a promising combination of power and speed. He’s a center fielder who is plus runner with an average arm. He has whippy bat speed, strong wrists and a tick above-average power. Martinez is a good low-ball hitter, and while his power comes with some swing-and-miss especially up in the zone, his strikeout rate should be manageable. His overall profile has similarities to a smaller version of Curtis Granderson. Martinez is working back into form after a long layoff from competitive baseball activity. He's likely to head to the Dominican Summer League to shake off some rust before coming to the U.S. later this year, likely with one of the Rangers Class A affiliates.

Scouting Report: McMahon possesses soft hands and a strong arm, but his reaction time was a concern at third base. He handled the move to first base well and, while physically large for second base, impressed the Rockies with how he adapted to the position, although opposing scouts are less convinced. Offensively, McMahon has a consistent, short stroke and uses the whole field. He sits fastball and takes advantage of mistakes, with the strength to produce above-average power in Coors Field. Strikeouts were an issue in the past, but McMahon significantly improved his approach and plate discipline and struck out just 97 times in 2017, compared to an average of 153 strikeouts his first three seasons.

Notes:
Hit: 55 | Power: 50 | Speed: 50 | Fielding: 50 | Arm: 60
Scouting Report: A $15.5 million signee out of Cuba in 2015, Diaz has started to turn his alluring package of strength, tools and athleticism, and he began to translate his raw gifts into consistent skills. Diaz has excellent contact ability and produces excellent exit velocities. He tends to drive the ball on a line from gap to gap rather than in the air, limiting his power production. Diaz expands the zone at times but is improving. He is an average runner but above-average underway on the basepaths and in the outfield. The Dodgers have begun to play him more often in center field this year, which increases his value and versatility. His plus arm allows him to play all three outfield positions. Diaz’s contact-oriented swing makes him more of a top-of-the-order table setter than a middle-of-the-order thumper, but his athleticism and versatility should get him to the big leagues before long.

Scouting Report: Barreto had two stints in the majors in 2017 and went just 14-for-71 (.197) thanks to a 43 percent strikeout rate. His minor league strikeout rate spiked from 18 percent at Double-A in 2016 to 28 percent at Triple-A in 2017. Developed as a shortstop, Barreto has spent time at second base in the minors and majors. He has the arm and range to play shortstop in the bigs but is better suited for second because his arm at short can be a little erratic. As a hitter, he uses the whole field and has more power than you'd expect from his stature, though he needs to make more contact. His plus speed makes him a base-stealing threat.

He has good anticipation off the bat, getting quick breaks with clean routes to give him above-average range, though with a below-average arm. Alford has a table-setter offensive profile with his on-base skills and speed. His elevated strikeout rate in 2016 was an aberration, with Alford showing a patient approach, good bat-to-ball skills and the ability to use the opposite field in 2017. Alford has never cracked double-digit homers in a season, though more power could come once he learns which pitches he can turn on to drive and elevate to his pull side.

Scouting Report: Morejon draws praise for his intangibles and poise as much as his stuff. He has an advanced understanding of how to set up hitters, mix his pitches and exploit weaknesses. His stuff isn't too shabby either. Morejon's fastball sits 91-93 mph and touches 95 in his starts and works 94-96 in short bursts. He throws two changeups that flash plus, one a diving knuckle-change and the other a traditional change with sink and run. His curveball shows above-average spin and power, but he gets rotational and his arm drags on the pitch at times, causing him to lose the strike zone. The same delivery flaw results in inconsistent fastball command.

Scouting Report: Alcantara packs big velocity but has yet to harness it. His fastball sits 96-97 mph as a starter, touches 100 and has been clocked as high as 102. It's a big pitch, but Alcantara's command and control are below-average, resulting in too many hittable fastballs over the plate or well off of it. He complements his power fastball with flashes of promising secondaries, but they aren't consistent. His curveball and slider run together into an 83-88 mph power breaking ball, but he is learning to separate them, and they both project to average. His 89-91 mph changeup is wildly inconsistent but flashes above-average potential.

Notes:
Hit: 55 | Power: 60 | Speed: 50 | Fielding: 55 | Arm: 55
Scouting Report: When healthy, Lewis has everything you want to see in a premier, middle-of-the-order outfielder. He plays the game hard and has the strong work ethic that allows him to make the most of his above-average tools. He has solid bat speed and a feel for the barrel, with plus raw power. It was obvious to scouts who saw him in the Cal League that he was not always in rhythm at the plate, with his upper half not syncing with his lower half, but he should get back in the groove when his knee is 100 percent healthy. His hands work well, and he's got a line-drive stroke with loft and home run power to all fields. Lewis' speed hasn't come all the way back, but he should again be an average runner when healthy, perhaps a tick more underway. While Lewis has primarily been a center fielder, scouts don't see the instincts needed to stay there despite his ability to cover plenty of ground. An above-average arm makes him better suited for right field. He's primarily been a DH since returning from his knee injury out of caution.

Scouting Report: Marsh flashed his five-tool potential as one of the best players in the Pioneer League in his pro debut in 2017, although he missed a month with a sprained thumb. A standout wide receiver who helped his high school team win Georgia AAAA state championships in 2013 and 2014, Marsh is an elite athlete with a strong frame, plus speed and plus arm strength. He looked a little raw offensively in instructional league last fall, but showed advanced plate discipline at Orem, sitting on pitches like a college hitter. Marsh has shown an ability to hit to all fields and could grow into more power as he matures physically. The way the ball comes off his bat leads some scouts to project above-average power in his future. The Angels believe Marsh has the speed and instincts to cover a lot of ground in center field, though he may eventually move to a corner spot.

Griffin Canning
Angels RHP
Notes:
Fastball: 60 | Slider: 55 | Curveball: 50 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 50
Scouting Report: A heavy workload as a junior at UCLA and a report of “potential issues” in a pre-draft MRI test didn't scare the Angels off Canning, a projected first-round pick who fell to the second round, No. 47 overall, and signed for $1.459 million. The Angels were comfortable with Canning's medicals, but were still very careful with him. Canning spent the summer in Arizona working on strength and conditioning and didn't pitch for an affiliate–making him one of the few top 50 picks to not get into an official game. Canning's four-pitch mix included a four-seam fastball between 90-94 mph with high spin rate that he commands, and in his pro debut in 2018 it jumped to 93-97. His slider, curveball and changeup all flash above-average potential. His changeup was his go-to secondary pitch as a college sophomore, but he threw more breaking balls as a junior, when he went 7-4, 2.34 in 119 innings over 17 starts, finishing second in the nation with 140 strikeouts, walking 32 and holding opponents to a .213 average. He showed durability under a robust workload in 2017, throwing a 134-pitch shutout of rival Southern California in early May. Canning is a polished and advanced college pitcher who could move quickly through the system, but he needs to show he is healthy. Canning already reached Double-A by April of his first professional season and projects as a mid-rotation starter.

Dane Dunning
White Sox RHP
Notes:
Fastball: 60 | Slider: 60 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 55
Scouting Report: Dunning operates primarily with a sinker and a slider, but he has a changeup as well. He sits in the low to mid-90s, peaking at 96 mph. When his delivery is clicking, Dunning features heavy sink and will coax hitters into beating the ball into the ground. He struggled at times to get out over his front side, which had a flattening effect on his stuff and resulted in an elevated-and out-of-character-home run rate of 1.1 per nine innings at high Class A Winston-Salem. Dunning's slider and changeup, both thrown in the low to mid-80s, have at least above-average potential. To maintain consistency and crispness on his pitches, he needs to stay tall through his delivery.

Ryan Mountcastle
Orioles 3B
Notes:
Hit: 60 | Power: 60 | Speed 45 | Field 45 | Arm 40
Scouting Report: Upon a promotion to Double-A Bowie last year, Mountcastle shifted from shortstop-where he had committed 13 errors in 82 games and showed a well-below-average arm-to third base. Early reports indicate the momentum taking him toward first base on most plays from the hot corner helps his arm tick up to below average. Many scouts believe he's ticketed for left field or first base. Mountcastle's plus raw power, advanced approach and plus hit tool will carry him, but he'll face added pressure because of his defensive profile. He gets good extension in his righthanded swing to attack the ball and hit with power to all fields, and has shown ability to recognize spin and stay with pitches.

Notes:
Fastball: 55 | Curveball: 60 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 55
Scouting Report: Burnes pounds the strike zone with quality stuff and growing confidence. He modified his delivery in 2017 by squaring up to the plate and allowing his lower half to drive toward the plate. At Biloxi, he even switched to a traditional windup instead of a modified stretch. With quick arm action, Burnes throws a 92-95 mph fastball with natural cut. He has three secondary pitches-a 77-80 mph curveball, a mid-80s slider and a high-80s split changeup-none of which grade much above-average, but he commands all three. His curve is his best secondary offering, but his slider is effective as well. Burnes maintains his stuff deep into starts with above-average control.

Scouting Report: Kelly remains a defense-first catcher, but the gap between his glove and his bat has shrunk. Behind the plate he shows soft hands, pristine footwork, good flexibility and a plus arm. He excels at game-calling and managing his staff. Kelly's biggest development has come on offense. Early in his career he was overaggressive early in counts, but he has become more patient and better at hunting fastballs he can drive. The result was a career high for home runs and OPS at Triple-A Memphis in 2017. He is still working on finding consistency in his load and timing.

Scouting Report: With another year under his belt, Abreu's fastball has ticked up even more. He now sits in the mid-90s with regularity and touches as high as 101 mph on occasion. He couples his fastball, which has average life, with a curveball and changeup that project to be at least average if not plus in the future. He still needs to refine his command, and some evaluators have seen more of a thrower than a pitcher at this point, but scouts inside and outside the organization see a pitcher with the upside of a No. 2 starter if everything develops.

Notes:
Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 60 | Changeup: 60 | Control: 45
Scouting Report: When his mechanics are synced, Manning can dominate, but as with many tall pitchers, that's not always the case. His arm slot varied in 2017 from over the top to more of a high three-quarters delivery. He also varied from being direct to the plate to throwing across his body. He struggled at low Class A West Michigan late in 2017, but when he put it together showed a plus 92-93 mph fastball that touched 96. His fastball has riding life up in the zone and can also be located down and away to righthanders. His above-average 12-to-6 curveball looks like a second future plus pitch. It's a late-count weapon that he doesn't consistently throw for strikes. His changeup is below-average.

Notes:

Scouting Report: O'Neill is short but cut like a bodybuilder with bulging muscles in his arms, legs and backside. He leverages that massive strength with lightning-quick bat speed, producing massive home runs observers recount with disbelief. He packs double-plus power and knows it, which sometimes gets him in trouble when he gets too steep uphill in his swing plane. O'Neill swings and misses enough to not project as more than a fringe-average average hitter, but when right he identifies pitches and draws walks. Despite his bulk, O'Neill is a solid athlete who posts average run times, adequately plays all three outfield positions and packs an above-average arm. He is best in right field.

Jonathan Loaisiga
Yankees RHP
Notes:
Fastball: 70. | Curveball: 60. | Changeup: 50. | Control: 50.
Scouting Report: Just two years ago, Loaisiga was out of baseball after being released by the Giants. Signed by the Yankees out of a tryout camp, he then was shut down for Tommy John surgery. He returned in 2017 to dominate the short-season New York-Penn League. Nothing on that resume prepared anyone for Loaisiga’s rocket-boosted rise to the Yankees this year. Despite coming into the season with just 2.1 innings of full-season experience, Loaisiga jumped straight to the high Class A Florida State League, then the Double-A Eastern League and then to the Yankees rotation. His near top-of-the-scale stuff (and the fact he was already on the 40-man roster) allowed him to make such a quick jump. His 94-98 mph fastball is a plus-plus pitch that he locates well. His 12-to-6 hard mid-80s curveball gives him a second plus pitch and he mixes in a sinking, hard 87-88 mph changeup is a useful average offering. Loaisiga has had a lengthy injury history, but if he can stay healthy, he has mid-rotation stuff.

Andres Gimenez
Mets SS
Notes:
Hit: 55 | Power: 40 | Speed: 50 | Fielding: 60 | Arm: 60
Scouting Report: Described as a "ball of dynamite" by one Mets official, Gimenez has a shorter, thicker build than many shortstops but compensates with twitchy athleticism. Scouts expect him to impact the ball more frequently as his body matures and he gains strength in his 20s. Gimenez pushed his average to .289 on Aug. 2, but he closed the year in an 18-for-91 (.198) skid as he dealt with a jammed thumb and general fatigue. Nothing phases Gimenez at the plate, where he has the attributes to be an above-average hitter. His lefthanded swing is direct to the ball, and he identifies pitches well, doesn't swing and miss often and hangs in versus southpaws. Skeptics question his batting upside potential, however, because he has average present running speed, while his power projects to be below-average because of his level swing plane and spray-hitting approach. Body control and quick actions serve Gimenez at shortstop, where he has above-average range, reliable hands and an arm that plays up to plus thanks to a quick release and accuracy. His instincts and feel for the game will keep him at shortstop-where he has plus defensive potential-as he climbs the ladder, while his arm and reliability would allow him to shift to second or third base as needed.

Scouting Report: Fowler had made strong progress through the Yankees' system, including a Double-A season in 2016 with 30 doubles, 15 triples, 12 homers and 25 stolen bases. Fowler's combination of speed and power gives him a chance to become an impact player. He has played the corner outfield spots but figures to stick in center given his range and solid arm. His plus speed makes him a basestealing threat, but he could improve his success rate. Fowler's recovery went as planned through the fall, and he is expected to be ready for spring training.

Angels 2B
Notes:
Hit: 50 | Power: 55 | Speed: 60 | Fielding: 55 | Arm: 50
Scouting Report: Pitchers exploited Jones' tendency to chase breaking balls early in 2017, and he hit just .165 at low Class A Burlington in his first 26 games. He rebounded to earn a July 20 promotion to high Class A Inland Empire. Jones makes consistent contact, sprays line drives all over the field, has plus speed and gap-to-gap power-and his defense is improving. His build is thick and strong, and the ball jumps off his bat. A short stroke and plus bat speed indicate that Jones could be an above-average hitter, but there are questions whether he'll be able to manage the strike zone. He doesn't project as a home run hitter but scouts like the adjustments he makes with two strikes, when he widens his stance, chokes up and tries to put the ball in play. An average arm could fit best in left field.

Scouting Report: Pearson gives hitters an uncomfortable at-bat. He attacks them with downhill angle from his 6-foot-6 frame and pitches with a lively, heavy fastball that parked at 92-94 mph and touched 98 regularly in his college starts. In short bursts with the Blue Jays, Pearson sat in the mid- to upper 90s and touched 101 mph, with the fastball life to get swings-and-misses up and down in the zone. His secondary stuff is inconsistent but shows flashes. His changeup is an average pitch with late fade, and he added power to his slider in pro ball. It now reaches the mid- to upper 80s with late tilt, though he's still learning to land it for a strike. He throws a curveball as well but it's behind his other pitches.

Padres RHP
Notes:
Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 45 | Changeup: 70 | Control: 70
Scouting Report: Paddack put up insane numbers to start his first full season in 2016, posting a 0.95 ERA with 48 strikeouts and two walks in 28.1 innings for the Marlins low Class A affiliate Greensboro. The Padres acquired him in a one-for-one trade for Fernando Rodney that June. Paddack was similarly dominant for three starts at low Class A Fort Wayne but succumbed to Tommy John surgery in July, ending his season and wiping out all of 2017 as well. He returned in May of 2018 and recommenced his dominance, opening with 24.2 consecutive scoreless innings. Paddack excels with a darting 90-95 mph fastball that explodes late through the zone, a plus-plus mid-80s changeup and elite control. His fastball-changeup combination is his bread-and-butter, but his mid-70s curveball has gradually improved to a usable pitch with 12-to-6 shape and decent depth as he's become more consistent with his release point. Paddack got bigger and stronger during his rehab and shown early hints of a velocity bump, although whether he can maintain it remains to be seen. Health is Paddack's biggest question mark. He missed six weeks with biceps tendinitis even before having Tommy John and has yet to pitch 50 innings in any season.

Blue Jays 2B
Notes:
Hit 55 | Power 60 | Speed 55 | Field 45 | Arm 60
Scouting Report: A long layoff combined with injury setbacks could explain some of Gurriel's 2017 struggles. At his best, he has shown good strike-zone discipline, though he got too aggressive in 2017, perhaps as he got used to facing better pitchers than he ever faced in Cuba. Gurriel is a long-armed hitter, so his swing will always have some length, but he doesn't strike out excessively and has above-average raw power. In his final season in Cuba, Gurriel improved his speed to above-average, though the leg injury held him back in 2017. Gurriel's range might be stretched at shortstop, but he has a strong arm and could fit well at third base.

Peter Alonso
Mets 1B
Notes:
Hit: 55| Power 60 | Speed 30 | Fielding 30 | Arm: 30
Scouting Report: Alonso generates by far the highest exit velocity and has the most power in the Mets system. He looks for pitches to elevate with his plus-plus raw power, and the ball carries to all fields when he connects. In addition to plus game power, Alonso has a chance for an average to above hit tool because he hits the ball hard with frequency and doesn't swing and miss as much as many sluggers. A well below-average runner and uncoordinated, slow-bodied defender, he committed 19 errors at first base in 2017, the majority of them fielding miscues and dropped catches. He requires a lot of work to be playable in the field. Alonso has crushed lefthanders as a pro, compiling a 1.166 OPS, but he hit a more modest .256/.316/.456 against same-side pitchers in his only full season to date. Regardless, his power will play in the big leagues, perhaps in the second half of 2018, whether as a regular or a platoon masher.

Notes:
Fastball 55 | Curveball 55 | Slider 50 | Changeup 50 | Control 70
Scouting Report: Bieber came to pro ball with a reputation for relying more on his command than his stuff to succeed. He has continued to show above-average control as a professional, and his walk rate of 0.5 per nine innings in 2017 led all full-season minor leaguers. But Bieber is starting to outgrow the command-and-control label, because his stuff made a jump in 2017. His fastball, which sat around 90 mph in college, now sits 92-94 and touched 96. His curveball got sharper and more consistent, developing into his best secondary pitch. He also throws a slider and changeup, which can both be average offerings. He has a clean, easy delivery and has shown he can handle a heavy workload--his 173.1 innings led all minor leaguers in 2017.

Astros RHP
Notes:
Fastball: 55 | Slider: 50 | Curveball: 45 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 55
Scouting Report: Martin was a reliever in the Texas A&M bullpen for two and a half seasons, but in his junior year he moved into the rotation. He became the team's Saturday starter and while his fastball velocity dipped a little, the command and the quality of his breaking balls improved with more work. The Astros signed Martin for $1 million as a second-round pick and used him in their tandem-starter system, something not all that unusual for Martin because of his multi-role background. Martin's 90-94 mph fastball has excellent glove-side life. He also throws an average slider that has bigger shape than most, with its break coming earlier than other sliders. His curve is a little behind the slider, and his changeup is generally below-average but it will flash above-average at times and could develop into a better weapon. Martin has a quick arm but his delivery has some effort and a high back elbow. He has the makings of four pitches and potentially average to above control, so there's no reason to not let him continue starting.

Hit: 60 | Power: 55 | Speed: 50 | Fielding: 50 | Arm: 50
Scouting Report: A switch-hitter with excellent bat speed from both sides, Franco has a short, pure stroke and keeps the barrel in the zone for an extended time. He shows good strike-zone discipline and advanced pitch recognition, and uses the entire field while making consistent contact. His raw power comes from his strong lower half, and he could generate impressive extra-base numbers as his body matures. Franco needs to learn the nuances of playing shortstop and hitting against premier pitching. Physically mature for his age, he possesses soft, quick hands and excellent first-step quickness. His arm is solid-average and could improve. He has the fluid actions that would allow him to play second base.

Notes:

Scouting Report: The Dodgers have a lengthy history of preferring catchers who combine receiving skills with the athleticism to also handle a spot in the infield. Russ Martin led the way, and Austin Barnes continued down that path. Now Smith has impressed as both a plus defender behind the plate with soft hands and an above-average arm and a capable second and third baseman who earns above-average defensive grades at the hot corner. Smith has retooled his swing as a pro to generate more loft and power. It’s resulted in lower batting average, but his ability to tap into average to above-average productive power makes it a fair trade.

Dodgers SS
Notes:
Hit: 55 | Power: 55 | Speed: 60 | Fielding: 50 | Arm: 55
Scouting Report: After struggling in the Midwest League, especially early in 2017, Lux worked to continue to fill out and get stronger in his second full pro seasons. That’s paid off in 2018 as he’s shown better power while retaining his ability to make contact and draw walks. Lux looks to be an above-average hitter with above-average power. Lux’s defense at shortstop is still a work in progress, largely because of his struggles with throwing accuracy. He had 17 errors at the season’s midpoint. Lux has played both second base and shortstop this season. Scouts believe he can stick at shortstop, although a team looking for a plus defender at shortstop will slide him to second.

Notes:
Hit: 60| Power: 50 | Speed: 50 | Fielding: 50 | Arm: 50
Scouting Report: Drafted 15th overall in 2016 and signed away from Liberty with a bonus of $2,817,100, the home-schooled prodigy raked his way to MVP honors in the Appalachian League after skipping the GCL in his first pro summer. Shut down late in the year with inflammation in his throwing elbow, he rehabbed all offseason but still had to have Tommy John surgery last March that wiped out his 2017 season. He returned fully healthy at the start of 2018. Drawing comparisons to such corner outfielders as Max Kepler and Christian Yelich, Kirilloff has strong wrists, quick hands, excellent balance and a smooth lefthanded swing. The year off gave him a chance to strengthen his lower half and pack on close to 30 pounds of muscle, which should enable him to get to his 15- to 20-homer potential sooner. Using an all-fields approach, he has an advanced understanding of the strike zone, outstanding barrel awareness and the almost effortless ability to hit for average. An average runner who has played center field but likely fits better in right, Kirilloff also shows soft hands at first base. That could be a fallback option down the road and a way to take stress off his elbow post-surgery.

Notes:
Fastball: 80 | Slider: 50 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 45
Scouting Report: Just as the Astros expected, Guzman developed a big-time fastball, but he exceeded even their expectations. He averaged 99 mph with his four-seamer in 2017 and just a tick less with his two-seamer. To put that in perspective, Guzman threw harder than Luis Severino (97.6 mph), the hardest throwing starter in the majors in 2017. He paired his fastball with a developing slider which was inconsistent but flashed average potential as well as a seldom-used changeup. He sometimes had trouble keeping his slider in the zone early in games before finding his feel later.

Notes:
Hit: 55 | Power: 55 | Speed: 50 | Fielding: 45 | Arm: 50
Scouting Report: The 28th overall pick in 2016, Kieboom had his full-season debut at low Class A Hagerstown shortened thanks to a hamstring injury, which forced him to the disabled list in mid-May and ended a torrid 29-game start in which he hit .333/.398/.586 with six home runs. After rehabbing and making his way back to the South Atlantic League, Kieboom hit just .235 the rest of the way--though he managed to show the same selective approach by walking 18 times compared to 15 strikeouts. He has a chance to turn into a middle-of-the order hitter, with impressive bat speed and a short swing. He shows the ability to drive the ball to all fields and could develop above-average power. Kieboom is an average defensive shortstop who projects to be more of a bat-first player. His high baseball IQ should help him in the field, where positioning and solid hands could be enough to make up for a lack of first-step quickness and an average arm. He showed improvement with his throwing in 2017, however. Even if he slides to second base, he could become a big league regular.

Notes:
Fastball: 70 | Slider: 60 | Curveball: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 50
Scouting Report: Graterol returned in 2017 from Tommy John surgery to rocket up the prospect charts while dominating at two levels. In his final outing of a season capped at 40 innings and 75 pitches in any individual outing, he struck out five in the first three innings of an elimination-game win that sent Rookie-level Elizabethton on its way to a four-game winning streak and the Appalachian League title. After sitting at 87-88 mph with his fastball pre-surgery, Graterol used the rehabilitation process to completely remake his body and his repertoire. Now 6-foot-1 and 225 pounds after packing on nearly 60 pounds of good weight, most noticeably in his legs and hindquarters, he has boosted his fastball to 95-98 mph with flashes up to 101 mph. That enabled him to blow past Double-A righty Fernando Romero for ownership of the best fastball in the system. Graterol also has a late-breaking plus slider at 85-89 mph and a hard curve at 80-83 mph that has a chance to be above-average. His 86-89 mph changeup projects as at least average with good action and feel for his age. With outstanding work ethic and aptitude that point toward continued improvement, Graterol has the highest ceiling of any Twins pitching prospect, projecting rotation-topping potential.

Christin Stewart
OF Tigers
Notes:
Hit: 50| Power: 60 | Speed: 40 | Fielding: 40 | Arm: 30
Scouting Report: Stewart easily led the Tigers organization in home runs in each of his two full seasons and ranks second in the minors with 58 home runs over the past two years. Like most power hitters in today's game, Stewart strikes out, but not excessively. He is prone to chase out of the zone because he's looking to do damage whether early or late in counts. He does have some zone awareness and when he stays within himself, he can generate power from a relatively compact swing. Stewart is a little pull happy, but he has the ability to drive the ball out to all fields. Stewart is a below-average runner who is unlikely to be more than an average hitter, but with 25-30 home run power given regular at-bats. The concerns about Stewart revolve around when he's wearing an outfielder's glove. He has worked hard to improve his defense, and he has seen some improvement, but he's still well below-average. Most scouts say it's unrealistic to see him as anything better than a future 40 defensively on the 20-to-80 scouting scale. He's limited to left field by a well below-average arm. Stewart's best position is designated hitter, but few teams break in rookies at DH. To play left field regularly, he'll have to be a prodigious hitter to make up for his defensive limitations, which adds to his risk. Stewart either is an everyday regular or a minor leaguer, but his swing gives him a chance to be a productive power hitter.

Padres 1B
Notes:
Hit: 55 | Power: 60 | Speed: 40 | Fielding: 45 | Arm: 55

The Marlins made Naylor the highest-drafted Canadian position player ever when they selected him 12th overall in 2015 and signed him for $2.2 million. One year later the Padres acquired him in the five-player trade that sent Andrew Cashner to Miami. Naylor is stocky with a protruding belly, closer to 260 pounds than his listed 225. Because the Padres have signed Eric Hosmer to a long-term deal, they have tried Naylor in left field this year. Most scouts are skeptical that he can handle left field, but he’s a fringe-average first baseman, which is his true position. Like any first baseman, Naylor has to hit and he’s down so. He’s shown the ability to recognize balls out of the pitcher’s hand, waiting to find a pitch he can drive. With bat speed and pitch recognition, Naylor has the ability to be an above-average hitter with plus power.

Notes:
Hit: 45 | Power: 60 | Speed: 45 | Fielding: 55 | Arm: 55
Scouting Report: In three seasons as Maryland’s shortstop, Smith showed excellent defense, bat speed and power potential, but his struggles to make contact meant he never hit for average in college, which explains why he slid to the fourth round in the 2017 draft. Since then, Smith has eliminated a loop in his swing. With a shortened, quicker stroke that helps him better catch up to velocity, Smith has shown both improved contact skills and even better power. At shortstop, Smith stands out for his reliability more than flashy range, but he’s sure-handed and has an above-average arm that should allow him to stay at the position. He has a chance to be an everyday shortstop with above-average to plus power.

Scouting Report: A former infielder who played on Colombia's 18U World Cup team as a 15-year-old in 2013, Hernandez signed for $225,000 and moved behind the plate with the Rays. He emerged as a legitimate dual-threat receiver in 2017 at Rookie-level Princeton after battling a groin injury for two years in the Dominican Summer League. This year has just added to the already-lofty expectations that surrounded him coming into the season as he’s proven to be one of the better hitters in the Midwest League. Scouts are surprised to discover Hernandez's limited experience behind the dish based on his ability. He has plus-plus arm strength. Hernandez does a solid job blocking balls in the dirt. Hernandez is on an upward trajectory that has seen him emerge as one of the organization's premier prospects.

Danny Jansen
Blue Jays C
Notes:
Hit: 55 | Power: 40 | Speed: 30 | Fielding: 45 | Arm: 50
Scouting Report: A broken left hand sidelined Jansen for three months in 2015 and a broken hamate bone in his left hand in 2016 put him out for two months that season. Healthy in 2017, Jansen broke through, hitting a combined .323/.400/.484 in a season he spent primarily at Double-A New Hampshire but finished at Triple-A Buffalo. Jansen's success stems from excellent strike-zone judgment. He walked (41) more often than he struck out (40) because he tracks pitches well, has a disciplined approach and doesn't chase much off the plate, enabling himself to get into advantageous counts and draw walks to get on base. Jansen makes frequent contact with a pull-minded, line-drive approach and enough power to hit 10-15 home runs, with his value coming more from his on-base skills than his power. Behind the plate, Jansen blocks balls well, but his arm strength is fringe-average and he threw out just 24 percent of baserunners in 2017

Freddy Peralta
Brewers RHP
Notes:
Fastball: 55 | Slider: 50 | Changeup: 55 | Control 45
Scouting Report: Peralta is confident and aggressive on the mound, challenging hitters with a fastball in the low to mid-90s, with good movement and improved command. He has deception with a bit of a crossfire delivery, and hitters have trouble picking up the ball, leading to plenty of swings and misses. Because of his “disappearing fastball,” many have compared him with former Brewers starter Mike Fiers, who got the job done without an overpowering fastball because hitters picked up the ball so late. Peralta repeats his delivery well and mixes in a slider to keep opponents off his fastball. He also has an above-average changeup he throws for strikes with deceptive arm speed. Peralta strikes out opponents with seeming ease but still issues too many walks and must improve his control. He displays good mound presence and a feel for pitching, particularly given his youth. He's an intelligent pitcher with good instincts. Despite concerns about Peralta's size, the Brewers believe he can be a mid-rotation starter because of his stuff and intangibles

Nick Neidert
Marlins RHP
Notes:
Fastball: 50. | Changeup: 60. | Slider: 50. | Control: 60.
Scouting Report: The Mariners' first selection in 2015, Neidert claimed California League pitcher of the year honors in 2017 after going 10-3, 2.76 at high Class A Modesto. The Marlins acquired Neidert, shortstop Chris Torres and righthander Robert Dugger after the 2017 season in the deal that sent Dee Gordon and international bonus pool money to Seattle. Neidert's aggressive approach allows him to excel. He goes right at hitters, has advanced feel for his secondary pitches and shows good poise on the mound. He effectively sequences his three pitches and throws strikes. Neidert's fastball sits 90-93 mph but plays up with carry through the zone due to a late hop in his delivery. Both of his secondary offerings--an average low-80s slider and future plus changeup at 78-81 mph with deception and fade--play up because of how well he commands them. He repeats his high three-quarters delivery, keeping hitters off balance. Neidert has a high aptitude for his craft with the ability to quickly make adjustments. Some observers don't see a true out pitch in Nediert's arsenal, but he succeeds because of his competitive nature and advanced pitchabilty. He projects as a No. 4 starter.

Calvin Mitchell
Pirates OF
Notes:
Hit: 60 | Power: 55 | Speed: 40 | Fielding: 50 | Arm: 40
Scouting Report: Mitchell was considered one of the best high school bats in the nation going into his senior year at Rancho Bernardo High in 2017. The year before he had finished second in the home run derby at the Perfect Game All-American Classic, and he helped Team USA win the Pan American Championships. He struggled early in his senior year, going through an 0-for-22 stretch at one point, which caused his stock to fall significantly. Mitchell, however, found consistency late in his senior season and ended up hitting .369 with 11 home runs. He finished his first pro season in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League with 12 hits in 36 at-bats in his last 10 games. The Pirates were never bothered by the slump and still considered Mitchell one of the best high school bats in the draft. He has a smooth lefthanded stroke, good command of the strike zone, and a quick enough bat to let the ball get deep and drive it to the opposite field. He has good power, and should be able to generate above-average home run production when he adds weight to a long frame. He has slightly below-average speed and average defensive tools, however, which means he profiles as a corner outfielder and will need his bat to play.

Nick Gordon
Twins SS
Notes:
Hit: 50 | Power: 45 | Speed: 50 | Fielding: 50 | Arm: 55
Scouting Report: At Double-A Chattanooga in 2017, Gordon slashed his way to an appearance at the Futures Game. He managed just 13 extra-base hits after June 18, however, and hit .211 over his final 180 at-bats. Lefties have given him trouble at multiple levels, but overall his hit tool tops his list of attributes. Not a burner like his brother but an instinctive runner, Gordon shows advanced barrel awareness to go with sound plate discipline and a line-drive swing that produces gap power. His range is just average and he struggles at times with footwork, hop anticipation and throwing accuracy.

Jonathan Hernandez
Rangers RHP
Notes:
Fastball: 60 | Slider: 60 | Curveball: 45 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 50
Scouting Report: Hernandez throws 94-96 mph and can reach 98 mph. His fastball has an effective combination of velocity and movement, with good armside run and a high spin rate that he took advantage of last year by elevating it to get swings-and-misses up in the zone, which helped his strikeout rate jump from 17 percent in 2016 to 23 percent in 2017. His slider has progressed from an average to a potential plus pitch and his changeup flashes above-average to plus. He can also flip over a curveball early in the count. Hernandez throws across his body, which creates deception, but can also impede his control. Some of that may stem from overthrowing, a habit he tends to get into when he's in a jam or goes through the order a second time. Some scouts see Hernandez moving to the bullpen, though others see a potential starter.

Dylan Cease
White Sox RHP
Notes:
Fastball: 70 | Curveball: 60 | Changeup: 50 | Slider: 45 | Control: 40
Scouting Report: Cease's best pitch is a hard, mid-90s fastball that reaches 98 mph and has tickled triple-digits in the past. It's elite velocity plays up with sink as well. Cease couples his fastball with a hard, 12-to-6 curveball that he uses to get swings-and-misses, and projects as a plus pitch. His changeup has made progress, but it's still a distant third pitch. He's also added a slider to his arsenal. Cease's below-average command and control have improved some, but he still walked 4.2 batters-per-nine innings across the Class A levels the past year. There's some thought, because of his two dominant pitches, Cease might have more success as a high-leverage reliever. It's too early for that move now and the White Sox will continue developing him as a starter.

Sean Murphy
Athletics C
Notes:
Hit: 45 | Power: 50 | Speed: 30 | Fielding: 60 | Arm: 70
Scouting Report: Murphy's defense will probably define him as he progresses through the A's system, although he's no slouch offensively. Murphy's arm is universally plus-plus, with some calling it an “80” tool. He's thrown out 41 percent of runners in his pro career, and most teams simply stop running on him. He knows how to call game from behind the plate and is a plus receiver and blocker. Pitchers love throwing to him not only for his defense but also for his baseball intellect. At the plate Murphy has a simple swing with not much of a load. He uses his considerable brute strength to bash the ball up the middle and to his pull side. He doesn't project as much more than a fringe-average hitter, but his power could improve as he learns to better incorporate his lower half.

ONeil Cruz
Pirates SS
Notes:
Hit: 45 | Power: 60 | Speed: 55 | Fielding: 45 | Arm: 70
Scouting Report: Cruz went from being a 6-foot-1 15-year-old to a 6-foot-6 19-year-old. Thanks to his height, Cruz began playing third base for the Dodgers but after being sent to the Pirates in a trade for reliever Tony Watson, he’s focused on shortstop again. Scouts do not believe he will stay there long-term, but he does have some of the best tools in the minors. Scouts describe Cruz’s build as similar to that of NBA small forwards and shooting guards. His athleticism is also impressive as he is an above-average runner once he gets going. Cruz’s raw power is top of the scale with massive batting practice home runs and occasional in-game mammoth shots. His plus-plus arm is equally impressive and will serve him well either at third base or right field. Cruz is still raw at the plate, but he’s made strides at showing better pitch selection and contact ability to go with his massive power. Cruz is a high-risk, high-reward prospect, but he’s one that stands out as one of the higher-ceiling prospects in the minors.
