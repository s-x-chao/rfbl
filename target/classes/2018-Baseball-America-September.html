class="label">Notes:</span><p>Hit: 80 | Power: 70 | Speed: 40 | Fielding: 40 | Arm: 55<br><strong>Scouting Report: </strong>Guerrero is a prodigious offensive talent, with the combination of hitting ability, plate discipline and power in the mold of Manny Ramirez. Guerrero has high-end bat speed and outstanding bat control. With hitting mannerisms reminiscent of his father, Guerrero has a compact but aggressive swing. With his hand-eye coordination, he has excellent plate coverage, barreling premium velocity while also possessing the pitch recognition skills to square up all types offspeed pitches, too. He has plus-plus raw power now, with 30-homer years likely in his future and a chance for 40. He drew more walks (76) than strikeouts (62) in 2017 and has the potential to contend for batting titles. A gifted offensive player, Guerrero did not inherit his father's speed or athleticism. He trained as an outfielder when he was an amateur and figured to be a left fielder at best, but after the Blue Jays signed him they put him at third base. He has surprised scouts with his play there, improving his arm strength to above-average and showing the hands to be a playable defender. However, Guerrero is already so big and stocky as a teenager that it's going to be a challenge for him to maintain his weight. Even if he moves to first base or possibly left field, his bat is good enough to be a premium player there too.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="2"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">2</span> <span class="rank-movement no-movement"> – </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">2</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="mlb-player-image lazyloaded" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/3590/fernando_tatis.jpg?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/3590/fernando_tatis.jpg?preset=playerList@2x" alt="fernando_tatis.jpg" src="/media/3590/fernando_tatis.jpg?preset=playerList" style=""></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/10873/fernando-tatis-jr/" title="Fernando Tatis Jr.">Fernando Tatis Jr.</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">Padres</span> <span class="position">SS</span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Hit: 60 | Power: 60 | Speed: 50 | Fielding: 55 | Arm: 60<br><strong>Scouting Report: </strong>Early in 2017, Tatis would come to the plate without a plan and get caught swinging over breaking balls on the outer half, but he quickly adjusted and became a precocious mix of power and patience. He tracks pitches well and consistently drives hittable offerings with excellent extension and leverage through his swing. Balls jump off his bat from gap to gap, and he shows plus power with towering pull-side home runs. Tatis cut his strikeout rate each successive month at Fort Wayne, and at the time he was promoted, he led the Midwest League in walks. He enhances his offensive game with his basestealing ability. He is an average runner whose speed plays up on the bases with his instincts, reads and jumps. At shortstop, Tatis frequently makes highlight-reel plays and shows off a plus, accurate arm, but on a play-to-play basis, evaluators see fringy range and many project a move to third base if he grows bigger. Tatis will stay at shortstop for now and has the actions to stick there if he maintains his body. In addition to his physical talents, Tatis is a natural leader. He is nearly bilingual and an effective communicator with impressive self-awareness for his age.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="3"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">3</span> <span class="rank-movement no-movement"> – </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">3</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="mlb-player-image lazyloaded" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/3585/eloy_jimenez.png?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/3585/eloy_jimenez.png?preset=playerList@2x" alt="eloy_jimenez.png" src="/media/3585/eloy_jimenez.png?preset=playerList" style=""></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/3232/eloy-jimenez/" title="Eloy Jimenez">Eloy Jimenez</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">White Sox</span> <span class="position">OF</span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Hit: 60 | Power: 70 | Speed: 40 | Fielding: 45 | Arm: 45<br><strong>Scouting Report: </strong>Scouts who saw Jimenez last season used words like "man-child," "mutant" and "Superman." More specifically, Jimenez is an intimidating, strong-bodied prospect with a whip-quick bat capable of massive home runs. More than his raw power, which approaches the top of the scale, he is a diligent, dedicated worker. One manager recalled seeing Jimenez strike out multiple times during a game, then saw him on the field early the next day for tracking drills. Rival managers lamented not being able to find many holes in his swing, even when they pitched him backwards. And here's the scary part: Jimenez might not be done developing physically. He played all of 2017 at 20 years old and still has room to sculpt his body and add more strength, possibly becoming a perennial 40-home run threat. Jimenez has spent his career flipping back and forth between right and left field, with left his likely eventual home because of his below-average arm. He's also a tick below-average runner. Defense and speed were never expected to be selling points of his game, however. Jimenez is a hitter, period, with a mix of power and ability to get to it to change a game.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="4"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">4</span> <span class="rank-movement no-movement"> – </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">4</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="mlb-player-image lazyloaded" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/3588/nick_senzel.jpg?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/3588/nick_senzel.jpg?preset=playerList@2x" alt="nick_senzel.jpg" src="/media/3588/nick_senzel.jpg?preset=playerList" style=""></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/9756/nick-senzel/" title="Nick Senzel">Nick Senzel</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">Reds</span> <span class="position">3B/2B</span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Hit: 60 | Power: 60 | Speed: 55 | Fielding: 60 | Arm: 60<br><strong>Scouting Report: </strong>Scouts see plenty to like about Senzel from a tools standpoint, but those who have seen him time and again like the intangibles just as much. He runs hard, grinds out at-bats, takes extra bases, plays smart in the field and leads his team. He's not only the best player on the field but plays the hardest. That mentality is coupled with a good approach at the plate and a short, compact swing with good balance and bat speed, leading to high exit velocity off the bat. Opponents say they rarely see him get fooled, and he constantly barrels balls. While many questioned his power coming out of college, he has shown the ability to drive the ball to all fields. Among his 10 Double-A homers were multiple shots to center field and the opposite field. Though not a prototypical burner, he still shows above-average speed to go with good instincts on the bases. Defensively, Senzel has shown the potential to be a plus defender at third with a strong, accurate arm that he has shown he can use on the run. He played shortstop and second base in addition to third base in college, but he has proven to be a quick study at third.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="5"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">5</span> <span class="rank-movement no-movement"> – </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">5</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="mlb-player-image lazyloaded" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/3589/bo_bichette.jpg?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/3589/bo_bichette.jpg?preset=playerList@2x" alt="bo_bichette.jpg" src="/media/3589/bo_bichette.jpg?preset=playerList" style=""></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/9805/bo-bichette/" title="Bo Bichette">Bo Bichette</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">Blue Jays</span> <span class="position">SS</span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Hit: 70 | Power: 60 | Speed: 50 | Fielding: 50 | Arm: 55<br><strong>Scouting Report: </strong>Bichette loads his swing with an aggressive leg kick and unleashes a powerful swing with fierce bat speed. He's consistently on time and on plane through the hitting zone for a long time, which allows him to barrel balls at a high rate. Bichette has a good sense for the strike zone and uses the whole field, with above-average power and loft to go deep to all fields. Bichette’s biggest strides have come on the defensive side. While the consensus earlier in his career was that he would probably end up playing second or third base, Bichette now looks like a true shortstop. He he has improved his agility, getting good reads off the bat with quick feet, good body control and he turns double plays well with an above-average arm.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="6"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">6</span> <span class="rank-movement no-movement"> – </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">6</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="mlb-player-image lazyloaded" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/3586/victor_robles.jpg?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/3586/victor_robles.jpg?preset=playerList@2x" alt="victor_robles.jpg" src="/media/3586/victor_robles.jpg?preset=playerList" style=""></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/4750/victor-robles/" title="Victor Robles">Victor Robles</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">Nationals</span> <span class="position">OF</span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Hit: 60 | Power: 50 | Speed: 70 | Fielding: 70 | Arm: 60<br><strong>Scouting Report: </strong>Robles' advanced understanding of the strike zone and ability to recognize pitches have helped his quick hands play in the batter's box. He is currently an average power hitter but with the strength and bat speed to project more power as he continues to develop physically. He was pitched backwards frequently in the Carolina League, which he countered by regularly using the entire field and showing the ability to drive the ball to the right-center field gap. Robles is fearless in the box and sets up very close to the plate. He led the Carolina league with 17 hit by pitches despite having just 338 plate appearances. He plays with great energy and aggression, which can hurt him at times, particularly on the bases where he needs to improve his decision-making and basestealing ability, though that might be the only part of his game to nitpick. Robles improved the most in 2017 in the outfield, where he has improved his jumps and routes. He also made strides with his throwing accuracy. He's always had the tools to develop into a premier defensive center fielder, with well above-average speed and a plus arm, and he's now taking the steps to become more efficient.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="7"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">7</span> <span class="rank-movement no-movement"> – </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">7</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="mlb-player-image lazyloaded" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/3591/forest_whitley.jpg?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/3591/forest_whitley.jpg?preset=playerList@2x" alt="forest_whitley.jpg" src="/media/3591/forest_whitley.jpg?preset=playerList" style=""></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/9771/forrest-whitley/" title="Forrest Whitley">Forrest Whitley</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">Astros</span> <span class="position">RHP</span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Fastball: 70 | Curveball: 60 | Slider: 60 | Changeup: 55 | Cutter: 50 | Control: 55<br><strong>Scouting Report: </strong>Few young pitchers are as advanced as Whitley, and few can match the quality of his stuff. He entered 2017 with four quality pitches and left it with five. All his pitches are at least average and a trio are already plus. Pitching with an over-the-top arm slot emphasizes the downhill plane on his fastball, and Whitley can blow hitters away at 92-97 mph. He actually is even more comfortable toying with batters with his varied assortment of offspeed pitches, and he commands his breaking balls better than his fastball at this point in his career. His plus 84-87 mph slider has modest depth but strong tilt as it dances away from his opponent's bat head as it nears the plate. His 78-82 mph curveball is also plus with a big 12-to-6 break. At times his changeup will also show otherworldly movement, when it dives down and away from the barrel of lefthanded batters. And in 2017 he refined a 90-92 mph cutter that some scouts throw a plus grade on. With so many pitches, Whitley can stick one or two in his back pocket early in the game, then break them out the second time through the order. One of the few criticisms raised is that he's a slow worker. Whitley will miss the first 50 games of the 2018 season due to a suspension for an unspecified violation of baseball’s drug program.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="8"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">8</span> <span class="rank-movement no-movement"> – </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">8</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="mlb-player-image lazyloaded" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/3596/kyle_tucker.jpg?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/3596/kyle_tucker.jpg?preset=playerList@2x" alt="kyle_tucker.jpg" src="/media/3596/kyle_tucker.jpg?preset=playerList" style=""></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/6253/kyle-tucker/" title="Kyle Tucker">Kyle Tucker</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">Astros</span> <span class="position">OF</span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Hit:&nbsp;60 |&nbsp;Power:&nbsp;60 |&nbsp;Speed:&nbsp;50 |&nbsp;Fielding:&nbsp;55 |&nbsp;Arm:&nbsp;50<br><strong>Scouting Report: </strong>Tucker's swing has never been picture perfect. He begins his swing with the bat laid back over his shoulder, leading to a little bit of a sweepy beginning. But it's hard to argue with the results. His excellent hand-eye coordination leads to ton of contact, and as he has gotten stronger he's turned doubles into home runs. Tucker isn't a true center fielder, but he has a chance to be fringe-average there while being above-average in the corners with an average arm that works in either spot.

Hitting coordinator Rick Eckstein got him to use his hips and legs better, and that opened up the pull side for Lewis, who homered on a full count in his first pro plate appearance. With a high waist and wide shoulders, he showed excellent plate discipline and an all-fields approach that drew comps to Ian Desmond. Lewis has plus speed and advanced instincts on the bases, where he was caught stealing just three times in 21 attempts. Lewis saw time at shortstop, third base and center field in high school, and he worked hard with the Twins to improve his range at shortstop with better positioning and pre-pitch anticipation. He flashed plus arm strength before the draft but saw that wane under the Florida heat and an increased workload. A separated left shoulder suffered in high school hasn't been an issue so far. Lewis' makeup and work ethic are off the charts, and his demeanor and ability to connect with teammates, fans and media are reminiscent of Carlos Correa or a young Derek Jeter. After a week or so, Ramon Borrego, his GCL manager, was calling for Lewis to skip the Rookie-level Appalachian League and be promoted all the way to low Class A Cedar Rapids. That eventually came in early August.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="10"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">10</span> <span class="rank-movement rank-up"> <span class="fa-chevron-up fa"></span> </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">11</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="lazyload mlb-player-image" data-aspectratio="90/135" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/3678/jo_adell-2.jpg?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/3678/jo_adell-2.jpg?preset=playerList@2x" alt="jo_adell-2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" style="height: 135px;"></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/99308/jo-adell/" title="Jo Adell">Jo Adell</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">Angels</span> <span class="position">OF</span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Hit:&nbsp;60 |&nbsp;Power:&nbsp;70 |&nbsp;Speed:&nbsp;70 |&nbsp;Fielding:&nbsp;55 |&nbsp;Arm:&nbsp;60<br><strong>Scouting Report: </strong>The Angels believed Adell possessed the best combination of power, speed and arm strength in the 2017 draft.

The broad-shouldered, muscular Adell stands out most for his quick-twitch athleticism, bat speed, raw power and ability to make consistent hard contact. His quick hands allow him to get to high pitches and he shows maturity in his at-bats and work ethic. He may not become an elite defender but is solidly above-average in center or right field.

He possesses the bat speed to handle any velocity and the balance and pitch recognition to barrel breaking balls. At times Rodgers becomes too pull-happy, but he has shown he has the strength to drive the ball the other way. Rodgers rarely walks, but knows how to work a count and doesn't miss the pitch he wants. Evaluators nearly universally regard him as a future plus hitter with enough power to impact a game. A natural shortstop, Rodgers has also seen time at second and third base with the Rockies' approach of having players work at multiple positions in the minors. Rodgers has the reliable hands, quick release and plus arm strength to play shortstop, but his fringy footspeed could be a deciding factor in an eventual move to second base. Rodgers makes up for his lack of natural range by positioning himself well and showing advanced instincts, enough that some evaluators give him a chance to stay at shortstop and be a possibly average defender there, although not all are convinced.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="12"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">12</span> <span class="rank-movement rank-up"> <span class="fa-chevron-up fa"></span> </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">13</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="lazyload mlb-player-image" data-aspectratio="90/135" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/8267/jesus_luzardo.jpg?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/8267/jesus_luzardo.jpg?preset=playerList@2x" alt="jesus_luzardo.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" style="height: 135px;"></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/9796/jesus-luzardo/" title="Jesus Luzardo">Jesus Luzardo</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">Athletics</span> <span class="position">LHP</span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 55 | Changeup: 60 | Control: 55<br><strong>Scouting Report: </strong>Born in Peru and raised in South Florida, Luzardo was viewed by area scouts as a possible first-round pick in 2016 before he had Tommy John surgery that March. The Nationals are a team that has never shied away from draft talented pitchers who are recovering from Tommy John surgery. They drafted him in the third round and gave him a $1.4 million signing bonus. Luzardo had pitched in only three Gulf Coast League games in 2017 before Washington sent him to the Athletics in the deal that brought Sean Doolittle and Ryan Madson to the Nats. Luzardo's abbreviated 2017 season with three teams was impressive: a combined 1.66 ERA in 43.1 innings, with 48 strikeouts and five walks. Poised, confident and smart are adjectives used to describe the lefthander, and his stuff is prodigious too. Luzardo can reach 97 mph with his fastball and has solid command of his curveball. He's developing a changeup that is already seen as above-average by some scouts. He has a simple arm stroke and a repeatable delivery. He appears to understand the art of pitching quite well for someone who's a mere 20 years old. Considering Luzardo hasn't pitched above short-season, he remains many years away from the big league club. But also considering his tools and his refined skills at such a young age, he has the potential to rise to the level of a solid No. 3-or-better starter in the not-so-distant future.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="13"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">13</span> <span class="rank-movement rank-up"> <span class="fa-chevron-up fa"></span> </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">14</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="lazyload mlb-player-image" data-aspectratio="90/135" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/3592/michael_kopech.jpg?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/3592/michael_kopech.jpg?preset=playerList@2x" alt="michael_kopech.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" style="height: 135px;"></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/97849/michael-kopech/" title="Michael Kopech">Michael Kopech</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">White Sox</span> <span class="position">RHP</span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Fastball:&nbsp;80 |&nbsp;Slider:&nbsp;60 |&nbsp;Changeup:&nbsp;50 |&nbsp;Control:&nbsp;45<br><strong>Scouting Report: </strong>Kopech's calling card is his top-of-the-scale fastball, which sits in the upper 90s and regularly touches 100 mph with armside run and downhill plane.

When healthy, Honeywell mixes five pitches-count 'em, five!-with precision to keep hitters off balance. He works off his plus fastball that sits 92-93 mph and touches 96, and he features solid movement and above-average command. His best secondary pitch is a plus changeup, which coaxes hitters to chase outside the strike zone on occasion. He throws his above-average curveball primarily early in counts to set hitters up while altering their eye level. His above-average slider resides in the mid-80s and is developing into a plus pitch with its improving sharp break. Honeywell also throws a screwball, which earned him some recognition early in his career. He pulls the plus offering out of his bag a few times a game, and more often than not, the results are devastating. Honeywell is a cerebral pitcher who knows how to get opponents out, and he's never afraid to challenge batters. A driven and determined young man, Honeywell understands the need to make adjustments. He did just that over the course of 2017, improving the consistency of his release point and getting better extension on his fastball.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="17"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">17</span> <span class="rank-movement rank-up"> <span class="fa-chevron-up fa"></span> </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">18</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="lazyload mlb-player-image" data-aspectratio="90/135" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/3608/mike_soroka.jpg?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/3608/mike_soroka.jpg?preset=playerList@2x" alt="mike_soroka.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" style="height: 135px;"></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/6637/mike-soroka/" title="Mike Soroka">Mike Soroka</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">Braves</span> <span class="position">RHP</span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Fastball:&nbsp;60 |&nbsp;Slider:&nbsp;60 |&nbsp;Changeup:&nbsp;55 |&nbsp;Control:&nbsp;60<br><strong>Scouting Report: </strong>Soroka is a sinker/slider pitcher who touches 95 mph but lives at 90-93 mph with his two-seamer.

Soroka's plus breaking ball is hard to classify. At it's best it's an above-average 84-86 mph curveball because of 1-to-7 shape, but it's tighter and has a sharper break than normal. When his adrenaline is flowing, it morphs into a high-80s pitch with slider tilt. His changeup flashes above-average with some late run but could use more consistency.

Mize pitches off of a fastball that gets up to 97 mph but sits in the 93-95 range and a 70-grade splitter that's among the best offspeed offerings in the country. Typically a difficult pitch to control, even for professional pitchers, Mize locates the 86-89 mph splitter remarkably well, with powerful downward action. He also has a slider that is in the mid- to upper 80s that he's thrown with a different grip this spring than he had on previous occasions. He has two variations of the slider--one that is more firm and used as an out pitch and another that's softer with more of a curveball shape and used as a get-me-over strike. He has also added a cutter to his repertoire this spring that's in the 88-91 mph range and scouts have already graded it as a plus offering. On top of all of that, Mize also throws a slower changeup from a different grip than his power splitter, which falls in the low 80s with fade and sink. While technically he has a four-pitch mix, the variations to the splitter and slider give him six different offerings to attack hitters, each of which grade out as plus offerings for most scouts, headlined by the plus-plus splitter. The stuff, pitchability and performance give Mize the ceiling of a future ace, with his medical history being the only knock on his resume. Mize was shutdown with forearm issues during the spring and summer of 2017 and has had trouble staying healthy dating back to his time as a high school prospect in Springville, Ala.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="19"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">19</span> <span class="rank-movement rank-up"> <span class="fa-chevron-up fa"></span> </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">20</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="lazyload mlb-player-image" data-aspectratio="90/135" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/3674/wander_franco.jpg?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/3674/wander_franco.jpg?preset=playerList@2x" alt="wander_franco.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" style="height: 135px;"></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/80779/wander-franco/" title="Wander Franco">Wander Franco</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">Rays</span> <span class="position"> SS</span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Hit:&nbsp;70 |&nbsp;Power:&nbsp;55 |&nbsp;Speed:&nbsp;50 |&nbsp;Fielding:&nbsp;50 |&nbsp;Arm:&nbsp;50<br><strong>Scouting Report: </strong>A switch-hitter with excellent bat speed from both sides, Franco has a short, pure stroke and keeps the barrel in the zone for an extended time.

His bat speed gives him more raw power than his lean 5-foot-10 frame would suggest, but he more typically drives balls into the gaps than over the fence. He has an aggressive approach and doesn't walk much, but his excellent feel for the barrel means he also doesn't strike out much and is comfortable working behind in the count. Mejia has made strides defensively, has elite arm strength and has shown flashes of being a good receiver, although his overall receiving and effort level behind the plate draw mixed reviews. He has gotten comfortable speaking English, a key skill for him to work with his pitchers. Because Mejia's bat isn't far off from being ready for the big leagues, and because the Indians have Yan Gomes and Roberto Perez, a pair of excellent defensive catchers, in Cleveland, Mejia went to the Arizona Fall League to get experience at third base. He is naturally still learning the position but he will continue to see action at the hot corner in 2018.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="25"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">25</span> <span class="rank-movement no-movement"> – </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">25</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="lazyload mlb-player-image" data-aspectratio="90/135" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/3615/alex_verdugo.jpg?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/3615/alex_verdugo.jpg?preset=playerList@2x" alt="alex_verdugo.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" style="height: 135px;"></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/98313/alex-verdugo/" title="Alex Verdugo">Alex Verdugo</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">Dodgers</span> <span class="position">OF</span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Hit:&nbsp;60 |&nbsp;Power:&nbsp;50 |&nbsp;Speed:&nbsp;50 |&nbsp;Fielding:&nbsp;55 |&nbsp;Arm:&nbsp;70<br><strong>Scouting Report: </strong>Verdugo possesses a keen eye that led to more walks (52) than strikeouts (50) at Triple-A Oklahoma City, and he keeps it simple when he does get a pitch to hit.

He doesn't have much lift in his swing, but evaluators see enough strength and bat-to-ball skills to project about average power to go with a .290 or better average. Verdugo has average speed and it plays up in center field with good instincts and a quick first step. His best tool is his plus-plus, accurate arm.

Strongly built with wide shoulders and thick, sturdy legs, he averages 97 mph with his fastball and touches triple digits with ease. He holds his velocity deep into his starts, blowing hitters away even when they know his fastball is coming. Reyes' command is imperfect, but he excels at elevating his fastball to get swings and misses. He backs up his top-of-the-scale fastball with knee-buckling hammer curveball at 78-81 mph, and his previously raw 88-91 mph changeup began increasingly playing as plus. He also began experimenting with an 83-86 mph short slider. Reyes struggles at times finding a rhythm for his delivery and the result has been below-average control his entire career, the one issue that prevents him from profiling as a No. 1 starter. Reyes' track record of staying on the mound is also becoming increasingly spotty. He missed a month in 2015 with a sore shoulder, was suspended 50 games in 2016 after testing positive for marijuana in the Arizona Fall League and now has Tommy John surgery on his ledger. In response, he got noticeably stronger during his rehab, replacing fat with muscle and improving his eating habits to enhance his general fitness.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="28"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">28</span> <span class="rank-movement rank-up"> <span class="fa-chevron-up fa"></span> </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">29</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="lazyload mlb-player-image" data-aspectratio="90/135" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/3612/triston_mckenzie.png?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/3612/triston_mckenzie.png?preset=playerList@2x" alt="triston_mckenzie.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" style="height: 135px;"></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/6452/triston-mckenzie/" title="Triston McKenzie">Triston McKenzie</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">Indians</span> <span class="position">RHP</span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Fastball:&nbsp;60 |&nbsp;Curveball:&nbsp;60 |&nbsp;Changeup:&nbsp;55 |&nbsp;Control:&nbsp;55<br><strong>Scouting Report:</strong> McKenzie's fastball can get up to 95 mph and averaged about 92 in 2017. He held that velocity throughout the season, and while it would dip during starts, he also showed the ability to reach back for more at the end of his outings. His fastball plays up and gets swings and misses thanks to the extension in his delivery and the high spin rate on the pitch. He also has a feel for spinning his curveball, which can be an out pitch.

He rarely swings and misses, and projects as a true plus-plus hitter.

He's not just a hitter, however, as Madrigal possesses plus-plus running ability and matches that skill with savvy baserunning prowess. A potential top-of-the-order hitter, Madrigal also projects as a plus defensive second baseman at the next level. The hands that allow him to hit with such apparent ease also translate to the field, where he is sure-handed and quick around the bag with enough arm strength for the keystone. Arm strength is the one knock on Madrigal--aside from his size--and scouts are split on whether he can be a major league shortstop, as Oregon State teammate Cadyn Grenier's defense was enough to push Madrigal to second base in 2016.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="31"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">31</span> <span class="rank-movement rank-up"> <span class="fa-chevron-up fa"></span> </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">32</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="lazyload mlb-player-image" data-aspectratio="90/135" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/8617/alex_kirillof.jpg?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/8617/alex_kirillof.jpg?preset=playerList@2x" alt="alex_kirillof.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" style="height: 135px;"></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/9765/alex-kirilloff/" title="Alex Kirilloff">Alex Kirilloff</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">Twins</span> <span class="position">OF</span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Hit: 60| Power: 50 | Speed: 50 | Fielding: 50 | Arm: 50<br><strong>Scouting Report: </strong>Drafted 15th overall in 2016 and signed away from Liberty with a bonus of $2,817,100, the home-schooled prodigy raked his way to MVP honors in the Appalachian League after skipping the GCL in his first pro summer. Shut down late in the year with inflammation in his throwing elbow, he rehabbed all offseason but still had to have Tommy John surgery last March that wiped out his 2017 season. He returned fully healthy at the start of 2018. Drawing comparisons to such corner outfielders as Max Kepler and Christian Yelich, Kirilloff has strong wrists, quick hands, excellent balance and a smooth lefthanded swing. The year off gave him a chance to strengthen his lower half and pack on close to 30 pounds of muscle, which should enable him to get to his 15- to 20-homer potential sooner. Using an all-fields approach, he has an advanced understanding of the strike zone, outstanding barrel awareness and the almost effortless ability to hit for average. An average runner who has played center field but likely fits better in right, Kirilloff also shows soft hands at first base. That could be a fallback option down the road and a way to take stress off his elbow post-surgery.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="32"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">32</span> <span class="rank-movement rank-up"> <span class="fa-chevron-up fa"></span> </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">33</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="lazyload mlb-player-image" data-aspectratio="90/135" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/3622/keston_hiura.jpg?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/3622/keston_hiura.jpg?preset=playerList@2x" alt="keston_hiura.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" style="height: 135px;"></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/99315/keston-hiura/" title="Keston Hiura">Keston Hiura</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">Brewers</span> <span class="position">2B</span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Hit:&nbsp;60 |&nbsp;Power:&nbsp;55 |&nbsp;Speed:&nbsp;45 |&nbsp;Fielding:&nbsp;45 |&nbsp;Arm:&nbsp;45<br><strong>Scouting Report: </strong>Hiura has a short, powerful stroke with tremendous bat speed and a good feel for the strike zone.

Offensively, Bart has plus raw power to all fields and has a solid track record in the ACC. Bart also has a solid wood bat track record, hitting .309/.389/.433 with two home runs in the Cape Cod League in 2016, which should help ease the worries of teams who might knock him for a poor summer in 2017, when he was dealing with a groin injury while playing for USA Baseball's Collegiate National Team. Bart does have a history of striking out a bit too much, and most evaluators put the hit tool at fringe-average at best, but the combination of his defensive tools and his ability to get to his power in-game at a position that is incredibly scarce.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="37"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">37</span> <span class="rank-movement rank-up"> <span class="fa-chevron-up fa"></span> </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">38</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="lazyload mlb-player-image" data-aspectratio="90/135" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/3633/austin_riley.jpg?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/3633/austin_riley.jpg?preset=playerList@2x" alt="austin_Riley.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" style="height: 135px;"></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/7298/austin-riley/" title="Austin Riley">Austin Riley</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">Braves</span> <span class="position">3B</span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Hit:&nbsp;55 |&nbsp;Power:&nbsp;60 |&nbsp;Speed:&nbsp;40 |&nbsp;Fielding:&nbsp;55 |&nbsp;Arm:&nbsp;70<br><strong>Scouting Report: </strong>Riley has embraced the Braves' focus on improving his nutritional habits.

Bohm got to that power frequently this spring, hitting .339/.436/.625 with 16 home runs. Perhaps more impressive than Bohm's power output--he also hit 11 homers as a sophomore and six as a freshman--is his improved plate discipline this season. He's cut his strikeout rate and significantly improved his walk rate, taking the free pass more frequently than striking out for the first time in his collegiate career. He has an exceptional understanding of the strike zone and always seem to have a plan when he steps in the batter's box, with the ability to make adjustments within an at-bat. His loud spring comes on the heels of a summer in the Cape Cod League, where Bohm was selected to the all-star game and finished second in the league with a .351 average. Bohm has done as much as anyone in the 2018 class to prove himself with the bat, but where the questions will surface for him are on the defensive side. Some scouts think Bohm will eventually have to move to first base due to his lack of range and agility, while others believe his strong arm will be enough for him to stay at the hot corner.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="40"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">40</span> <span class="rank-movement rank-up"> <span class="fa-chevron-up fa"></span> </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">41</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="lazyload mlb-player-image" data-aspectratio="90/135" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/3620/jesus_sanchez.jpg?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/3620/jesus_sanchez.jpg?preset=playerList@2x" alt="jesus_sanchez.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" style="height: 135px;"></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/8185/jesus-sanchez/" title="Jesus Sanchez">Jesus Sanchez</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">Rays</span> <span class="position"> OF</span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Hit:&nbsp;60 |&nbsp;Power:&nbsp;55 |&nbsp;Speed:&nbsp;55 |&nbsp;Fielding:&nbsp;50 |&nbsp;Arm:&nbsp;50<br><strong>Scouting Report: </strong>Sanchez has shown the ability to perform every aspect of the game at a young age.

He has a smooth and easy, whip-like swing from the left side and quick wrists that allow him to hit velocity and adjust to offspeed pitches. Most of his power has come when he pulls the ball, but given his age and raw strength, Sanchez should be a run producer at higher levels. His greatest need centers on gaining consistency with his leg kick so as not to drift on the front side. He also needs to improve his overall pitch selection.

Control has long been an issue, but A's minor league pitching instructor Gil Patterson helped Puk streamline his delivery, focusing mainly on his front leg. The altered motion produced a more consistent release point. With his 6-foot-7 height, Puk gets a pronounced downward angle in his delivery, which can make him both effective and intimidating.

India was ranked as the No. 82 player in the 2015 class, but after the Brewers drafted him in the 26th round he made his way to Gainesville. India was solid, but unspectacular, in his first two season with the Gators, missing some time with injury during his sophomore campaign in which he hit 274/.354/.429 with 23 strikeouts and 42 walks. He's improved his draft stock substantially this spring, hitting .350/.497/.717 with 21 home runs and more walks (60) than strikeouts (56). Scouts have been extremely happy to see his raw power translate more into games this year. His ultimate role will depend on his defensive position. He played a decent amount of innings at shortstop early this year, but most of his time with Florida has been at third base, where he has solid hands and an average arm. He's likely a third baseman or a second baseman at the next level, with the flexibility to move to shortstop in a pinch or for a team that doesn't prioritize shortstop defense. If third base is the destination, he has more than enough bat to profile there, especially if this year's power display is here to stay.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="44"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">44</span> <span class="rank-movement rank-up"> <span class="fa-chevron-up fa"></span> </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">45</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="lazyload mlb-player-image" data-aspectratio="90/135" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/8270/yusniel_diaz.jpg?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/8270/yusniel_diaz.jpg?preset=playerList@2x" alt="yusniel_diaz.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" style="height: 135px;"></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/9032/yusniel-diaz/" title="Yusniel Diaz">Yusniel Diaz</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">Orioles</span> <span class="position">OF </span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Hit: 55 | Power: 50 | Speed: 50 | Fielding: 50 | Arm: 60<br><strong>Scouting Report:</strong> A $15.5 million signee out of Cuba in 2015, Diaz has started to turn his alluring package of strength, tools and athleticism, and he began to translate his raw gifts into consistent skills.

Kieboom is an average defensive shortstop who projects to be more of a bat-first player.

The Angels were comfortable with Canning's medicals, but were still very careful with him. Canning spent the summer in Arizona working on strength and conditioning and didn't pitch for an affiliate–making him one of the few top 50 picks to not get into an official game. Canning's four-pitch mix included a four-seam fastball between 90-94 mph with high spin rate that he commands, and in his pro debut in 2018 it jumped to 93-97. His slider, curveball and changeup all flash above-average potential. His changeup was his go-to secondary pitch as a college sophomore, but he threw more breaking balls as a junior, when he went 7-4, 2.34 in 119 innings over 17 starts, finishing second in the nation with 140 strikeouts, walking 32 and holding opponents to a .213 average. He showed durability under a robust workload in 2017, throwing a 134-pitch shutout of rival Southern California in early May. Canning is a polished and advanced college pitcher who could move quickly through the system, but he needs to show he is healthy. Canning already reached Double-A by April of his first professional season and projects as a mid-rotation starter.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="48"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">48</span> <span class="rank-movement rank-up"> <span class="fa-chevron-up fa"></span> </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">50</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="lazyload mlb-player-image" data-aspectratio="90/135" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/3635/jon_duplantier.jpg?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/3635/jon_duplantier.jpg?preset=playerList@2x" alt="jon_duplantier.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" style="height: 135px;"></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/9807/jon-duplantier/" title="Jon Duplantier">Jon Duplantier</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">D-backs</span> <span class="position">RHP</span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Fastball:&nbsp;55 |&nbsp;Curveball:&nbsp;55 |&nbsp;Slider:&nbsp;55 |&nbsp;Changeup:&nbsp;50 |&nbsp;Control:&nbsp;60<br><strong>Scouting Report: </strong>Duplantier has an athletic build and a solid, sturdy frame with room to grow.

He throws both a four-seamer and a two-seamer and both pitches have armside run. His most consistent secondary pitch is a spike curveball, but coaches believe his new slider has the most upside. He also throws a changeup that generates average to above-average grades. Duplantier is proud that he was able to make all of his starts in 2017, saying he grew more confident in his health as the season progressed.

Nothing phases Gimenez at the plate, where he has the attributes to be an above-average hitter. His lefthanded swing is direct to the ball, and he identifies pitches well, doesn't swing and miss often and hangs in versus southpaws. Skeptics question his batting upside potential, however, because he has average present running speed, while his power projects to be below-average because of his level swing plane and spray-hitting approach. Body control and quick actions serve Gimenez at shortstop, where he has above-average range, reliable hands and an arm that plays up to plus thanks to a quick release and accuracy. His instincts and feel for the game will keep him at shortstop-where he has plus defensive potential-as he climbs the ladder, while his arm and reliability would allow him to shift to second or third base as needed.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="50"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">50</span> <span class="rank-movement rank-up"> <span class="fa-chevron-up fa"></span> </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">52</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="lazyload mlb-player-image" data-aspectratio="90/135" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/3655/matt_manning.jpg?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/3655/matt_manning.jpg?preset=playerList@2x" alt="matt_manning.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" style="height: 135px;"></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/9763/matt-manning/" title="Matt Manning">Matt Manning</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">Tigers</span> <span class="position">RHP</span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Fastball:&nbsp;60 |&nbsp;Curveball:&nbsp;60 |&nbsp;Changeup:&nbsp;60 |&nbsp;Control:&nbsp;45<br><strong>Scouting Report: </strong>When his mechanics are synced, Manning can dominate, but as with many tall pitchers, that's not always the case.

Martinez is subject to the new rules, which is why he had to settle for $2.8 million from the Rangers. Martinez had been one of the top players left in Cuba, having starred in the country’s junior leagues and then in Cuba’s top league, Serie Nacional, where in his final season he batted .333/.469/.498 in 264 plate appearances with 52 walks, 30 strikeouts, six home runs and 24 stolen bases in 29 attempts. Though he’s not that big, Martinez has a promising combination of power and speed. He’s a center fielder who is plus runner with an average arm. He has whippy bat speed, strong wrists and a tick above-average power. Martinez is a good low-ball hitter, and while his power comes with some swing-and-miss especially up in the zone, his strikeout rate should be manageable. His overall profile has similarities to a smaller version of Curtis Granderson. Martinez is working back into form after a long layoff from competitive baseball activity. He's likely to head to the Dominican Summer League to shake off some rust before coming to the U.S. later this year, likely with one of the Rangers Class A affiliates.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="54"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">54</span> <span class="rank-movement rank-up"> <span class="fa-chevron-up fa"></span> </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">56</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="lazyload mlb-player-image" data-aspectratio="90/135" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/8769/sean_murphy.jpg?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/8769/sean_murphy.jpg?preset=playerList@2x" alt="sean_murphy.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" style="height: 135px;"></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/9816/sean-murphy/" title="Sean Murphy">Sean Murphy</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">Athletics</span> <span class="position">C </span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Hit: 45 | Power: 50 | Speed: 30 | Fielding: 60 | Arm: 70<br><strong>Scouting Report: </strong>Murphy's defense will probably define him as he progresses through the A's system, although he's no slouch offensively.

In his final outing of a season capped at 40 innings and 75 pitches in any individual outing, he struck out five in the first three innings of an elimination-game win that sent Rookie-level Elizabethton on its way to a four-game winning streak and the Appalachian League title. After sitting at 87-88 mph with his fastball pre-surgery, Graterol used the rehabilitation process to completely remake his body and his repertoire. Now 6-foot-1 and 225 pounds after packing on nearly 60 pounds of good weight, most noticeably in his legs and hindquarters, he has boosted his fastball to 95-98 mph with flashes up to 101 mph. That enabled him to blow past Double-A righty Fernando Romero for ownership of the best fastball in the system. Graterol also has a late-breaking plus slider at 85-89 mph and a hard curve at 80-83 mph that has a chance to be above-average. His 86-89 mph changeup projects as at least average with good action and feel for his age. With outstanding work ethic and aptitude that point toward continued improvement, Graterol has the highest ceiling of any Twins pitching prospect, projecting rotation-topping potential.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="56"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">56</span> <span class="rank-movement rank-up"> <span class="fa-chevron-up fa"></span> </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">58</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="lazyload mlb-player-image" data-aspectratio="90/135" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/8624/chris_paddack.jpg?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/8624/chris_paddack.jpg?preset=playerList@2x" alt="chris_paddack.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" style="height: 135px;"></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/7634/chris-paddack/" title="Chris Paddack">Chris Paddack</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">Padres</span> <span class="position">RHP</span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 45 | Changeup: 70 | Control: 70<br><strong>Scouting Report: </strong>Paddack put up insane numbers to start his first full season in 2016, posting a 0.95 ERA with 48 strikeouts and two walks in 28.1 innings for the Marlins low Class A affiliate Greensboro.

Paddack was similarly dominant for three starts at low Class A Fort Wayne but succumbed to Tommy John surgery in July, ending his season and wiping out all of 2017 as well. He returned in May of 2018 and recommenced his dominance, opening with 24.2 consecutive scoreless innings. Paddack excels with a darting 90-95 mph fastball that explodes late through the zone, a plus-plus mid-80s changeup and elite control. His fastball-changeup combination is his bread-and-butter, but his mid-70s curveball has gradually improved to a usable pitch with 12-to-6 shape and decent depth as he's become more consistent with his release point. Paddack got bigger and stronger during his rehab and shown early hints of a velocity bump, although whether he can maintain it remains to be seen. Health is Paddack's biggest question mark.

He's flashed an average changeup already, but he was rarely asked to throw it at Florida. Teams more skeptical of Singer will see a two-pitch starter with a concerning arm slot that might lead to the bullpen, while less critical scouting departments might see a potential middle-of-the-rotation arm who has impressive strike-throwing ability and more high-level track record than any pitcher in a deep 2018 class.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="58"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">58</span> <span class="rank-movement rank-up"> <span class="fa-chevron-up fa"></span> </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">60</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="lazyload mlb-player-image" data-aspectratio="90/135" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/3602/austin_hays.jpg?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/3602/austin_hays.jpg?preset=playerList@2x" alt="austin_hays.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" style="height: 135px;"></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/9799/austin-hays/" title="Austin Hays">Austin Hays</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">Orioles</span> <span class="position">OF</span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Hit:&nbsp;55 |&nbsp;Power:&nbsp;60 |&nbsp;Speed:&nbsp;50 |&nbsp;Fielding:&nbsp;55 |&nbsp;Arm:&nbsp;60<br><strong>Scouting Report: </strong>A baseball rat who has endeared himself to Orioles brass for his lack of batting gloves and a playing style that's energetic-bordering-on-reckless, Hays' compact swing and above-average bat speed help him attack the ball and drive it to all fields, and he has proved to be particularly adept at hitting fastballs in any count.

While he is less likely to be an ace, Perez also is about as safe a bet as a young pitcher can be to become a big league starter. For a young pitcher, he already understands many of the finer details of his craft. He responds quickly to instruction and shows an aptitude for adjustments. After working on a new grip for his slider in just one side session, he successfully took it into his next game. Perez generally sits 92-94 mph, though he can touch 96. Some scouts believe he may end up throwing a little harder in his 20s because his delivery is clean and he has plenty of athleticism. What's most notable is that Perez commands all four of his pitches. His 75-80 mph curveball is his best secondary pitch. He has long had an ability to spin it with 12-to-6 break, and he has shown he can loosen it as an early-count strike or tighten it up as a swing-and-miss out pitch. His changeup is a potentially average pitch as well, with more deception than late fade. His newly-added slider comes in at 88-89 mph with late movement. Perez hasn’t pitched yet in 2018 due to a right lat strain and he is expected to be out until late June.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="67"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">67</span> <span class="rank-movement rank-up"> <span class="fa-chevron-up fa"></span> </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">69</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="lazyload mlb-player-image" data-aspectratio="90/135" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/8795/logan_allen.jpg?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/8795/logan_allen.jpg?preset=playerList@2x" alt="Logan_Allen.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" style="height: 135px;"></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/6807/logan-allen/" title="Logan Allen">Logan Allen</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">Padres</span> <span class="position">LHP</span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Fastball: 55 | Curveball: 50 | Slider: 50 | Changeup: 60 | Control: 50<br><strong>Scouting Report: </strong>At his best, Allen sits 92-94 mph with his fastball and shows off a potential plus changeup and above-average curveball. At other times he's 89-91 mph with just average secondaries. He shows the poise and pitchability to succeed even when his stuff isn't at his best. Allen is aggressive with his fastball and establishes it early in games. He complements it with a “Vulcan” grip changeup he holds between his middle and ring finger that dives as it approaches the plate for a swing-and-miss offering. Allen still is trying to find a consistent release point on his hard, slurvy curveball, but he shows flashes of snapping it off. He's begun showing an average slider he can land for strikes as well. Allen throws all his pitches for strikes but can get wild in the zone. The Padres have smoothed out his delivery, making it less herky-jerky, and his command and pitch efficiency have improved as a result. Allen looks like a mid-rotation starter at his best, but needs to continue to iron out his command and gain consistency of his stuff.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="68"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">68</span> <span class="rank-movement rank-up"> <span class="fa-chevron-up fa"></span> </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">70</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="lazyload mlb-player-image" data-aspectratio="90/135" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/8620/danny_jansen.jpg?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/8620/danny_jansen.jpg?preset=playerList@2x" alt="danny_jansen.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" style="height: 135px;"></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/5166/danny-jansen/" title="Danny Jansen">Danny Jansen</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">Blue Jays</span> <span class="position">C </span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Hit: 55 | Power: 40 | Speed: 30 | Fielding: 45 | Arm: 50<br><strong>Scouting Report: </strong>A broken left hand sidelined Jansen for three months in 2015 and a broken hamate bone in his left hand in 2016 put him out for two months that season. Healthy in 2017, Jansen broke through, hitting a combined .323/.400/.484 in a season he spent primarily at Double-A New Hampshire but finished at Triple-A Buffalo. Jansen's success stems from excellent strike-zone judgment. He walked (41) more often than he struck out (40) because he tracks pitches well, has a disciplined approach and doesn't chase much off the plate, enabling himself to get into advantageous counts and draw walks to get on base. Jansen makes frequent contact with a pull-minded, line-drive approach and enough power to hit 10-15 home runs, with his value coming more from his on-base skills than his power. Behind the plate, Jansen blocks balls well, but his arm strength is fringe-average and he threw out just 24 percent of baserunners in 2017</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="69"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">69</span> <span class="rank-movement rank-up"> <span class="fa-chevron-up fa"></span> </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">71</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="lazyload mlb-player-image" data-aspectratio="90/135" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/8615/peter-alonso.jpg?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/8615/peter-alonso.jpg?preset=playerList@2x" alt="peter alonso.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" style="height: 135px;"></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/9878/peter-alonso/" title="Peter Alonso">Peter Alonso</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">Mets</span> <span class="position">1B</span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Hit: 55| Power 60 | Speed 30 | Fielding 30 | Arm: 30<br><strong>Scouting Report: </strong>Alonso generates by far the highest exit velocity and has the most power in the Mets system. He looks for pitches to elevate with his plus-plus raw power, and the ball carries to all fields when he connects. In addition to plus game power, Alonso has a chance for an average to above hit tool because he hits the ball hard with frequency and doesn't swing and miss as much as many sluggers. A well below-average runner and uncoordinated, slow-bodied defender, he committed 19 errors at first base in 2017, the majority of them fielding miscues and dropped catches. He requires a lot of work to be playable in the field. Alonso has crushed lefthanders as a pro, compiling a 1.166 OPS, but he hit a more modest .256/.316/.456 against same-side pitchers in his only full season to date.

At that time, Liberatore was sitting mostly in the upper 80s and low 90s with his fastball and had a low-70s, 12-to-6 curveball, as well as a changeup in the low to mid-80s. He performed well on the showcase circuit and with USA Baseball's 18U National team, pitching in the USA's 8-0 win over Korea in the gold medal game. During his first outing this spring, however, he was up to 96 mph with his fastball, a sharper curveball and a plus changeup. The 100-plus scouts could confidently leave that game and project three plus pitches on the prep lefthander who stood 6-foot-5. While the stuff hasn't been quite as loud for Liberatore since then, his fastball in particular hasn't held that velocity--he still has the frame and pitchability that teams can dream on, with a fairly clean and quick arm as well as makeup that scouts rave about. The Arizona commit pitches with a bulldog-like mentality on the mound but also brings a cerebral approach to what he's trying to do, with an advanced understanding of how to attack hitters and how to manipulate his pitches. During the spring, Liberatore added a low-80s slider that he showcased to a large group of evaluators at USA Baseball's National High School Invitational. The pitch is currently behind his curveball and changeup--both of which project as plus offerings--but showed some promise.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="72"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">72</span> <span class="rank-movement rank-up"> <span class="fa-chevron-up fa"></span> </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">74</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/98681/jarred-kelenic/" title="Jarred Kelenic">Jarred Kelenic</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">Mets</span> <span class="position">OF</span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Hitting: 60 | Power: 55 | Speed: 50 | Defense: 55 | Arm: 60<br><strong>Scouting Report: </strong>Kelenic was the only outfielder in the high school class to unanimously make the first team in Baseball America's Preseason All-America vote, as decided on by major scouting directors. Kelenic achieved that honor as one of the best hitters in the class with a balanced and powerful swing, a track record in the middle of USA Baseball's 18U National Team lineup and a strong arm, as well as athleticism, above-average speed and impressive route running. One of the most intense players in the class, Kelenic has a fiery demeanor on the field that gives pause for some evaluators, while others who know him have no issues and see his passionate personality as a positive indicator. He lives and breathes baseball and is regularly in his dad's training facilities in Waukesha, Wis., and also worked out in the same facility as Houston Texans' defensive end J.J. Watt. One of the more polished hitters in the class, Kelenic has the frame and strength to continue to add more power as he gets into player development and could wind up with plus raw power down the road. As he ages, scouts are mixed on whether he stays in center field or moves to a corner, with his backers pointing to exceptional reads and defensive instincts, and detractors saying that his speed will back up as he gets stronger. He has more than enough arm for the outfield, regularly registering 96 mph readings from the grass and regarded as one of the most accurate arms in the class. The challenge with Kelenic is that he's been difficult for teams to scout this spring in Wisconsin. He's playing with a travel team rather than his high school and he's also been seen indoors more frequently than outdoors. The track record for Wisconsin hitters is also poor, but Kelenic's own track record with Team USA and on the showcase circuit, combined with his natural tools and makeup, could allow him to become the exception. He should be one of the first prep bats to get drafted this June.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="73"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">73</span> <span class="rank-movement rank-up"> <span class="fa-chevron-up fa"></span> </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">74</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="lazyload mlb-player-image" data-aspectratio="90/135" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/8616/corbin_martin.jpg?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/8616/corbin_martin.jpg?preset=playerList@2x" alt="corbin_martin.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" style="height: 135px;"></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/97919/corbin-martin/" title="Corbin Martin">Corbin Martin</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">Astros</span> <span class="position">RHP</span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Fastball: 55 | Slider: 50 | Curveball: 45 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 55<br><strong>Scouting Report: </strong>Martin was a reliever in the Texas A&amp;M bullpen for two and a half seasons, but in his junior year he moved into the rotation. He became the team's Saturday starter and while his fastball velocity dipped a little, the command and the quality of his breaking balls improved with more work. The Astros signed Martin for $1 million as a second-round pick and used him in their tandem-starter system, something not all that unusual for Martin because of his multi-role background. Martin's 90-94 mph fastball has excellent glove-side life. He also throws an average slider that has bigger shape than most, with its break coming earlier than other sliders. His curve is a little behind the slider, and his changeup is generally below-average but it will flash above-average at times and could develop into a better weapon. Martin has a quick arm but his delivery has some effort and a high back elbow.

Garcia lived up to his scouting report in his first season in 2017 in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League. He used extremely quick hands and an advanced hitting approach to spray balls all over the field. He can rely on his hands a bit too much at the plate currently, and the next phase of his development will be getting his legs into his swing with more consistency. A plus-plus runner, Garcia gets down the line well and swiped 11 bases in 13 tries in his debut. Defensively, he has above-average arm strength, smooth actions and soft hands at shortstop, but he'll need a few years to continue honing the fundamentals and getting acclimated to the speed of the game. Garcia has moved extremely quickly in 2018 and is one of the youngest players in high Class A.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="75"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">75</span> <span class="rank-movement rank-up"> <span class="fa-chevron-up fa"></span> </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">76</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="lazyload mlb-player-image" data-aspectratio="90/135" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/8793/ronaldo_hernandez.jpg?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/8793/ronaldo_hernandez.jpg?preset=playerList@2x" alt="ronaldo_hernandez.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" style="height: 135px;"></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/8179/ronaldo-hernandez/" title="Ronaldo Hernandez">Ronaldo Hernandez</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">Rays</span> <span class="position">C</span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Hit: 55 | Power: 55 | Speed: 40 | Fielding: 55 | Arm: 70<br><strong>Scouting Report: </strong>A former infielder who played on Colombia's 18U World Cup team as a 15-year-old in 2013, Hernandez signed for $225,000 and moved behind the plate with the Rays.

Because the Padres have signed Eric Hosmer to a long-term deal, they have tried Naylor in left field this year. Most scouts are skeptical that he can handle left field, but he’s a fringe-average first baseman, which is his true position. Like any first baseman, Naylor has to hit and he’s down so.

The Marlins acquired Neidert, shortstop Chris Torres and righthander Robert Dugger after the 2017 season in the deal that sent Dee Gordon and international bonus pool money to Seattle. Neidert's aggressive approach allows him to excel. He goes right at hitters, has advanced feel for his secondary pitches and shows good poise on the mound. He effectively sequences his three pitches and throws strikes. Neidert's fastball sits 90-93 mph but plays up with carry through the zone due to a late hop in his delivery. Both of his secondary offerings--an average low-80s slider and future plus changeup at 78-81 mph with deception and fade--play up because of how well he commands them. He repeats his high three-quarters delivery, keeping hitters off balance. Neidert has a high aptitude for his craft with the ability to quickly make adjustments.

Scouts do not believe he will stay there long-term, but he does have some of the best tools in the minors. Scouts describe Cruz’s build as similar to that of NBA small forwards and shooting guards. His athleticism is also impressive as he is an above-average runner once he gets going. Cruz’s raw power is top of the scale with massive batting practice home runs and occasional in-game mammoth shots. His plus-plus arm is equally impressive and will serve him well either at third base or right field. Cruz is still raw at the plate, but he’s made strides at showing better pitch selection and contact ability to go with his massive power.

He plays shallow, challenging hitters to hit it over his head. If they do, he proves he can track balls over his head with ease. He's one of the best defensive center fielders in the minors and has Gold Glove potential with an above-average arm. Pache's speed plays on the basepaths, too. At the plate, his swing has some length that leads scouts to see a future average hit tool, but he has shown improved strike-zone recognition and solid bat-to-ball skills. Scouts love his athleticism and believe that once he fills out he'll hit for at least average power, and this year for the first time as a pro he’s starting to drive the ball over the wall.

He looked a little raw offensively in instructional league last fall, but showed advanced plate discipline at Orem, sitting on pitches like a college hitter. Marsh has shown an ability to hit to all fields and could grow into more power as he matures physically. The way the ball comes off his bat leads some scouts to project above-average power in his future.

Suarez's fastball velocity has steadily ticked up from 88-92 in 2016 to 89-93 mph in 2017 to 90-94 this season, and he excels at busting his fastball in on rigthhanders for an uncomfortable at-bat. His changeup is a swing-and-miss pitch that he sells with identical arm speed, drawing foolish swings over the top. He's developing a curveball as a quality third pitch, landing it to his armside well but still learning to put it on the back foot of righthanded hitters. Suarez works with an exceptionally quick pace, commanding the tempo and keeping hitters on the defensive. With his constantly improving stuff, Suarez's strikeouts have increased from 5.7 batters per nine innings in 2015 to 10.7 in 2016 to 11.8 in 2017 to 12.5 in 2018. Suarez doesn't make many mistakes, having allowed only 10 homers in 251.1 minor league innings. He has above-average pitchability and an easy, repeatable high-three quarters delivery with good direction to the plate, allowing him to maintain his velocity and control.

He's a bit of a free swinger at this point, but he has offensive upside, with learning to lay off sliders a key developmental focus.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="88"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">88</span> <span class="rank-movement rank-up"> <span class="fa-chevron-up fa"></span> </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">89</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="lazyload mlb-player-image" data-aspectratio="90/135" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/8999/ke_bryan_hayes.jpg?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/8999/ke_bryan_hayes.jpg?preset=playerList@2x" alt="ke_bryan_hayes.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" style="height: 135px;"></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/6508/kebryan-hayes/" title="Ke'Bryan Hayes">Ke'Bryan Hayes</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">Pirates</span> <span class="position">3B</span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Hit: 55 | Power: 45 | Speed: 50 | Fielding: 60 | Arm: 60 |<br><strong>Scouting Report: </strong>Hayes shows feel for the strike zone, a compact swing and the ability to drive the ball to all fields.

Expected physical gains have come too. Lambert now sits 92-93 mph and touches 96 with his fastball, dialing it up and down as necessary.

Both his biting 78-82 mph curveball and mid-80s changeup consistently project above-average-to-plus, and he plays them off his fastball expertly. Lambert throws everything for strikes and keeps the ball down, a critical factor in his success pitching in environments similar to Coors Field.

He adjusted quickly in his first full season however, cutting his strikeout rate to below 20 percent at low Class A Rome. Scouts are divided on the switch-hitter's overall hitting potential. There are some who don't believe Waters' funky swing will work consistently at higher levels, but other scouts see loose hands and an ability to whip the bat head through the zone that compensates for a noisy and high-maintenance swing. He's already toned down what was an exaggerated leg kick that messed with his timing. Scouts are more confident in the rest of his tools. He has an excellent frame and the strength to develop power by getting bigger and stronger over the next few years.

However, Crouse repeats his arm slot well and is able to locate his fastball to both sides of the plate, with his long arms and legs flying at the hitter helping to enhance his deception.

Rooker still has some swing-and-miss in his game, especially on power breaking balls and soft stuff from lefties, but his walk rate should improve along with his pitch recognition. Primarily a first baseman in college, Rooker showed enough mobility and arm to be a tick below average in left. He is a smart baserunner despite below-average speed. After ranking second in Division I with an average exit velocity of 92 mph, Rooker matched that number in the FSL during his first pro summer.

De los Santos lead the Padres organization in innings (150) while going 10-6, 3.78 at Double-A San Antonio in 2017. In his first year with the Phillies, De Los Santos has proven to be a reliable starter for Triple-A Lehigh Valley. De Los Santos has one of the better fastballs in the Phillies system, a 94-98 mph bullet he commands to both sides of the plate. His fastball has excellent carry through the zone, and his improved fastball command has made it true weapon that draws swings-and-misses and weak ground-ball contact. De Los Santos relies heavily on that fastball as he doesn’t command or control his secondaries nearly as well. His slurvy 75-77 mph curveball flashes average but he lacks consistent feel for it and his harder, short 80-82 mph slider has promise but is not yet a consistent above-average offering.

Scouts who see Toussaint on a good night throw an easy plus grade on his 93-95 mph fastball and a plus-plus grade on his 12-to-6 hammer curveball. After tweaking his grip, his changeup has improved to become a useful, average third pitch that he can throw for strikes as well. It lacks late drop, but it has good deception and separation. He's an excellent athlete with long arms and a solid frame. Toussaint has yet to develop the consistency to go with his stuff, and his fastball proves more hittable than its velocity would indicate. Too often, his control wanders and he leaves hittable fastballs up in the zone. When he runs into trouble, he has yet to figure out how to limit the damage. With a long arm action, Toussaint has yet to show he can consistently repeat his delivery, leading to below-average control. His stuff is so electric, however, that even a slight improvement in his control allowed him to skyrocket from Double-A to Triple-A to the majors in 2018 . The pieces are there for Toussaint to be a solid mid-rotation starter, but he still has plenty of work to do on control and consistency.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="99"><div class="list-ranking"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">99</span> <span class="rank-movement rank-up"> <span class="fa-chevron-up fa"></span> </span></div><div class="previous-rank">Last: <span class="previous-rank-number">100</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="lazyload mlb-player-image" data-aspectratio="90/135" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/9234/dl_hall.jpg?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/9234/dl_hall.jpg?preset=playerList@2x" alt="dl_hall.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" style="height: 135px;"></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/99311/dl-hall/" title="D.L.

But was one of the best pitchers at Orioles instructional league and impressed club officials with his consistent release point along with his pitchability. He carried that over into his first full pro season, posting a 2.10 ERA in the South Atlantic League and allowing one run or less in each of his final 13 starts. Even with expected physical maturation, Hall's fastball already grades as plus from the left side at 92-95 mph, with the ability to throw inside to both lefties and righties. His 1-to-7 curveball projects as an above-average pitch, with his changeup presently below-average but with average potential. Though far from the majors, Hall showed the best breaking ball among the high school class of 2017 and could blossom into a mid-rotation starter. His health and success at low Class A Delmarva have him off to the right start.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li><li class="clearfix" data-rank="100"><div class="list-ranking triple-digit"><div class="current-ranking"><span class="rank-number">100</span></div></div><div class="player-details-container"><div class="player-image"><img class="lazyload mlb-player-image" data-aspectratio="90/135" height="135" width="90" data-src="/media/9279/bryse_williams.png?preset=playerList" data-src-2x="/media/9279/bryse_williams.png?preset=playerList@2x" alt="bryse_williams.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" style="height: 135px;"></div><div class="player-details"><h3><a href="/players/9844/bryse-wilson/" title="Bryse Wilson">Bryse Wilson</a></h3><div class="team-position-container"><span class="team">Braves</span> <span class="position">RHP</span></div></div><div class="player-notes"><span class="label">Notes:</span><p>Fastball: 60 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 55 <br><strong>Scouting: </strong>A football star in high school who played quarterback, running back, wide receiver, linebacker and punter, Wilson's athleticism and "do-anything" mentality have served him well on the mound. After sailing through low Class in his first full season, Wilson shot from high Class A through Double-A and Triple-A all the way to the majors as a 20-year-old in 2018. The Braves believe Wilson has special makeup, which he combined with plenty of stuff. Wilson pitches off of his 93-95 mph fastball that touches 97, and the development of his changeup has really helped him take a step forward. He was a fastball/slider pitcher before, but his newly-refined changeup has given him a needed third weapon that is at least average, although he slows his arm down some when he throws it. Wilson's delivery has a lot of length in his takeaway and a wrap, which leads some scouts to worry that it will be difficult for him to ever consistently snap off his slider, but when it's on it's an above-average pitch. Wilson's potentially above-average control, strong frame and three-pitch mix gives him a shot to be a future mid-rotation starter.</p></div></div><div class="desktop-only spacer"></div></li></ol><div class="loading-container" style="display: none;"><img src="/img/loading.gif" alt="Loading"></div><div class="more-btn-container text-center"><a href="#" class="more-btn btn btn-alt" style="display: none;"> See more <span class="fa-chevron-down fa"></span> </a></div></section></div><div class="wrapper"><div class="tablet-up featured-spot"><div id="div-gpt-ad-desktop-4133-3" style=""><script>googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-desktop-4133-3');});</script><div id="google_ads_iframe_/21666240671/baseball.america/rankings/2018-top-100-prospects/_1__container__" style="border: 0pt none;"><iframe id="google_ads_iframe_/21666240671/baseball.america/rankings/2018-top-100-prospects/_1" title="3rd party ad content" name="google_ads_iframe_/21666240671/baseball.america/rankings/2018-top-100-prospects/_1" width="970" height="90" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" srcdoc="" style="border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;"></iframe></div></div></div><div class="featured-spot phone-only" style=""><div id="div-gpt-ad-mobile-4133-13" style=""><script>googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-mobile-4133-13');});</script><div id="google_ads_iframe_/21666240671/baseball.america/rankings/2018-top-100-prospects/_3__container__" style="border: 0pt none;"><iframe id="google_ads_iframe_/21666240671/baseball.america/rankings/2018-top-100-prospects/_3" title="3rd party ad content" name="google_ads_iframe_/21666240671/baseball.america/rankings/2018-top-100-prospects/_3" width="320" height="50" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" srcdoc="" style="border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;"></iframe></div></div></div></div></div><footer id="site-footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="social-links"><a class="fa-stack fa-sm facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/BaseballAmericaMag/" target="_blank" title="Facebook"> <span class="fa fa-facebook-f fa-stack-1x"></span> </a> <a class="fa fa-youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BaseballAmericaVideo" target="_blank" title="YouTube"></a> <a class="instagram" href="https://www.instagram.com/baseballamerica/" target="_blank" title="Instagram"> <img src="/img/instagram-icon.svg" alt="Instagram"> </a> <a class="fa-stack fa-sm twitter" href="https://twitter.com/BaseballAmerica" target="_blank" title="Twitter"> <span class="fa fa-twitter fa-stack-1x"></span> </a></div><ul class="footer-links list-unstyled"><li><a href="https://www.baseballamerica.com/terms-of-use/" data-nodeid="1150">Terms of Use</a></li><li><a href="https://www.baseballamerica.com/privacy-policy/" data-nodeid="1173">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="https://www.baseballamerica.com/sitemap/" data-nodeid="1082">Sitemap</a></li></ul><p class="copyright">Copyright © 2019 Baseball America Enterprises. <br class="mobile-only"> All rights reserved.</p></div></footer><div id="paywall-banner"><div class="wrapper wrapper-x-small"><div class="paywall-left"><span class="stories-used"></span> of <span class="total-stories"></span> <span class="free-stories-text">Free Stories Remaining</span></div><div class="paywall-right"><a href="/sign-up/" class="btn">Join Now</a> <a href="https://my.baseballamerica.com/" class="login pp-login"> <span class="fa fa-user-circle-o"></span> Login </a></div></div></div><div class="media-query-listener desktop-view"></div><div class="media-query-listener mobile-view"></div><div class="nav-overlay"></div><script src="/bundles/footerScripts?v=jrCgFqBWZNT0NyDGPZ_v5Hj9KfE6pIUAZUlolcGWXf81" defer=""></script><script src="//players.brightcove.net/5819061528001/default_default/index.min.js" defer=""></script><iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" style="background-color: transparent; border: 0px; display: none;"></iframe><div id="GOOGLE_INPUT_CHEXT_FLAG" input="" input_stat="{&quot;tlang&quot;:true,&quot;tsbc&quot;:true,&quot;pun&quot;:true,&quot;mk&quot;:true,&quot;ss&quot;:true}" style="display: none;"></div>
